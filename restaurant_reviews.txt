Saldanha Bakery | 18224075 | (22.5557437485, 88.3580046147) | https://www.zomato.com/kolkata/saldanha-bakery-wellesley | ['Bakery', 'Desserts']

Saldanha Bakery | Shaurya Pathak | 367302 | 4.0 | 2016-12-17 21:09:23 | It will be a time taking process to find this place. But it will test your resolve for the love of food.
Don't look around. Just look down and enjoy the lip smacking goodies. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Kashif Ahmed | 1115831 | 4.5 | 2016-12-14 19:10:28 | Surprisingly, this joint serves the best Walnut Cakes i have ever tasted in my life..... It is a very old bakery.... The patties is also lip smacking....
Strongly recommend the Walnut Cake, try it once....But kindly refrain from taking your vehicle as parking is a serious pain..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Amrita Mondal | 36255179 | 4.0 | 2016-10-28 21:36:46 | The best bakery in town for traditional Christmas goodies like fruit cake, walnut cake, plain butter cake, plum cake, Brownies, tarts, etc. It is a place where bulk orders are taken generally. It is not a shop or a cafe. It is a bakery where you order stuff and take away. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tuks4 | 36484659 | 4.5 | 2016-10-25 00:29:07 | ive been an indirect customer of this bakery for a while.. my sis's school orders their items regularly and i get to taste them too :)
this time though, i went to the place & had my own order.. a good number of chicken & corn envelope & choc truffle cake, both eggless & w/ egg..

my 1 line verdict.. the BEST bakery in the city.. period. in terms of taste + price + raw materials + the care + the old-school process, this is without doubt the best place in Calcutta.. & i repeat CALCUTTA and not kolkatta or kolkutta or some other rubbish misnaming this city gets !
this is the place that makes proper patties, proper macrones, cakes & pastries.. almost all of their items taste uniquely clean & refined.. and someone with a decent palette, will feel the 'non-commercial' taste as well..

i had a client team visiting from Poland who were extremely happy eating these items..¬† chicken envelope is their costliest item @35 a pc.. v filling yet flaky & light.. the choc truffle cake melted away inside the mouth.. super soft !
ul see amul butter being used to fry the onions.. pure almond crumbs being used inside the cake's base.. egg whites been beaten for 30mins until those nice soft peaks show up.. no wonder the taste is superlative !

few downsides to mention.. the cheese puff is not good at all.. slice cakes are sometimes stiff.. the place can do better without being that cluttery.. someone with a nose for hygiene might not be thrilled with all the 'hands' being used.. but i guess that too is their USP at some point :) |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anushka Agarwal | 34748091 | 3.5 | 2016-10-24 11:21:12 | Been to this joint lately and loved their brownies and cakes. They are freshly baked and delicious both at the same time. Usually if you go to this place during late evening you'll miss out on most of the stuffs. Pre-ordering recommended. ‚úåüèªÔ∏è |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Debadyuti Karan | 5018051 | 4.0 | 2016-08-30 22:52:05 | Kolkata is full of sweet surprises. Who would ever guess that an old yellow house in central Kolkata houses one of the best bakeries in town?! A cake lovers paradise, this bakery is famous for its weddings cakes for the Anglo Indians. Good things don't come easy; one needs to make an effort to relish their creations. A pre order is a must at this 80 year old bakery. While most of their stuff is good, the must must must on the order list would be their almond cake, coconut macaroons and their soft moist dark brownies. If you are lucky and drop by you might find some' bakes' of the day that you could pick up. Debra Saldanha one of the daughters now runs the place and maintains the high quality standard set by her parents. The place is not a fancy store. They know their quality is far better than most bakeries in town and they let their baking do the talking. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Rajtilak Bhattacharjee | 68484 | 5.0 | 2016-08-20 22:28:12 | The best bakery in Kolkata. Must try their almond cakes, macaroons, and chocolate fudges. You can pre-order, although there is no home delivery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Indrajit Lahiri | 542545 | 4.5 | 2016-08-02 16:47:16 | There goes around a story in Kolkata gastronomic circuit that the best traditional l anglo-Indian cakes are found not in fancy hotels, but in few homes, and over the period of time, they‚Äôve become legends. Many have heard of the name, but few have actually been there, the name‚Äôs Saldanha Bakery and Confectionary

One should reach Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road (the tram road) and find out the B C Sen Jewellery shop on it. While in the afternoon, the traffic moves towards north, it comes on the right hand side. Take the adjacent lane and after 50-100 mtrs, you can find a yellow house on your left with Saldanha written on the outside wall. Parking is a big big problem. Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tisyaketu Sirkar | 3479861 | 5.0 | 2016-07-14 13:57:20 | This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Sumit Surai | 11641 | 4.0 | 2016-07-13 22:52:39 | This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Arjun Kumar Roy | 33434945 | 5.0 | 2016-05-18 00:48:34 | Its an amazing bakery where we get great some authentic baked products. Please try their cakes, mousses and other stuff... Its one the oldest in our city and serves you upto your expectations... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anwesha Ghosh | 14295941 | 3.5 | 2016-02-12 19:26:47 | One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Jude Martin | 1895578 | 4.0 | 2016-01-26 23:48:16 | Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Suhail Hassan | 684685 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 15:28:43 | Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items**** |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Koushik Paul | 16411585 | 4.5 | 2016-01-09 10:10:47 | What to say about this!! It is actually a hidden gem! One of my friend suggested this for Christmas cake shopping. It made us tired to find it out but cakes are actually superb!!! |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Oindrila Paul | 16152668 | 5.0 | 2016-01-08 00:38:34 | I will give 5 stars to this bakery because I've eaten here many a times and if has never let me down. Right from it's vegetarian items to the non vegetarian ones, and from the pastries to the cakes, Saldanha is pure bliss |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Madhurya Chaudhuri | 30816267 | 4.5 | 2016-01-06 21:09:10 | Awesome cakes,brownies,lemon drops and chicken patties . British cakes are the best. Assorted chocolates are good too. And everything comes in a very reasonable price. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Swarnendu Chandra | 32142557 | 5.0 | 2016-01-02 14:06:38 | I visited this place after reading a report in a local newspaper, and experience was mesmerizing. The walnut cake and fruit cake was simply delicious. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Souvik Sen | 9493051 | 4.5 | 2015-12-29 16:56:20 | Great Cakes I must say...This year I had their walnut & chocolate cakes in Christmas...Both was fabulous...Walnut was better...Price was INR 220/- per cake but considering the quality it really worth it..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Apple Orange | 31197595 | 5.0 | 2015-12-25 17:26:35 | I have never been to the shop but in our office every year during Christmas we get cakes from Saldanah Bakery and it is never enough...The Christmas cakes are simply what a first class cake should be...soft ...fresh and...the level sweetness is just right..love it every year and now it's  a ritual...will be visiting soon..üòäüòäüòä |

Monkey Bar | 18361667 | (22.544307, 88.352079) | https://www.zomato.com/kolkata/monkey-bar-camac-street-area | ['American', 'Asian', 'European', 'North Indian']

Monkey Bar | Sirsha Dhar | 2015246 | 4.5 | 2016-12-15 21:54:11 | My friend, who was leaving the city soon wanted to go out for food and drinks and what could have been better than our decision to hit the Monkey Bar. Finally opened in Kolkata, one of the best-located bar there possibly is. On the 9th floor of Fort Knox on Camac Street, this looks down the beautiful Kolkata skyline with the 2nd bridge, Victoria, St. Pauls church and what not. The place is huge, quaintly decorated with the essential Bong touch both in the menu and the bar. Has an open area with a huge screen. 
For food we ordered the Mobar Caramelised Pork Ribs. Melt in the mouth pork meat. Smoked Chicken, Chicken Salami and Harissa pizza. For drinks we took the Beamer LIIT. Just the right punch of alcohol and tang! Lovely experience. Would definitely like to go back again. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohan Belani | 3081061 | 3.5 | 2016-12-15 02:58:39 | The place has a chill vibe . Went with a few school buddies.  There is a open air section as well as an indoor section where you can sit and chill . Drinks were nice . Service could be better . The staff were not attentive enough . Lastly the music . There were people singing karaoke. I mean it's cool to sing and all but we expected some chill music with the setting . |
 
Monkey Bar | Pratik Shah | 31614924 | 3.0 | 2016-12-14 13:50:20 | With an indoor and outdoor seating options and great ambience "monkey bar" is sure to impress you . I didnt order much to eat , bt watever i ordered was average - 
Yes it is lil on the expensive side - overall good place to chill once in a while . |
 
Monkey Bar | Shruti Bhaiya | 593379 | 4.0 | 2016-12-11 17:47:13 | A must go places for the party peeps in kolkata.  Good food , good music and an awesome ambience. .  A complete thumbs up .. the only thumbs down would be the quantity  of the food served , it's too little and gives u just a taste of the dish !! |
 
Monkey Bar | Avinaba Das Sarkar | 409341 | 3.0 | 2016-12-11 11:02:59 | Went yesterday with a business partner, wasn't really very particular about a place but since it was located near by thought of visiting it once. Few observations

1. The ambiance is nice and the interiors are pretty well done.

2. Music is pretty loud and if you are intending to have a prolonged conversation with someone it would be difficult. 

3. The biggest drawback is the food, we ordered two veg starters since my friend was veg. The quantity and the taste wasn't something justifying the price or the brand. The food was OK but it isn't something one will find difficult to prepare in there kitchen. 

Overall experience was okay since we primarily went there to seat and talk. But comparing the same with the likes to cafe mezzuna or the grid would make this place average at the best. Hope the management looks into it. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rishi Agarwal | 1632482 | 4.5 | 2016-12-10 17:02:43 | On the 9th floor at Fort Knox, the newly opened Monkey Bar is a beautiful place to visit. The place offers an unmatched view of the city and the interiors and a class apart which make it one step ahead of other places in the city.
The food on offer is delicious. The mushrooms I ordered and the chilli cheese dragons are a must try for all.
Overall a great new place to visit with a great atmosphere and very polite attendants. |
 
Monkey Bar | TraveKings | 29893242 | 4.5 | 2016-12-07 13:14:55 | Located at Fort Knox. It is like Social in Delhi. Good Ambience. Maintaining a Good Standard. Decent Crowd. Decent Hookah & Decent Food. Good Service.¬†2 big screen to enjoy live sports .¬†Little expensive. It will cost around Rs.3000 for 2 person.A Good place to hangout with friends. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sukanya Ghosh | 589490 | 3.5 | 2016-12-04 21:24:11 | This one is new in Kolkata, and is definitely pulling lot of crowd. I went there on a Friday evening with two of my friends and it was full of people. Located in camac street, near Urban Desi, not too difficult to locate. The moment you step in , the first thing you notice are the big french windows with a view to die for :), Howrah Bridge and Victoria Memorial at the same, who would not love that!¬†
Now coming to the food, its nothing extraordinary, very mediocre tasting with prices on the higher side. We ordered for 1 mix mushroom bruschetta, mushroom and truffle oil pizza, and tikki of joy (fish). The bruschetta and the pizza was very ordinary, bland in taste I would say. Tikki of joy was definitely good with very subtle flavours, perfectly cooked to perfection.
My rating is truly for the ambience and the fish, anyway one could always try out this place¬†
Thumbs up for the view :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Gunjan Saraf | 33964908 | 4.5 | 2016-12-03 14:49:16 | My visit to this place raised my bar of expectations from kolkatas nightlife.. Posh crowd, sophisticated ambience, soothing music, projector screen for matches, good food and superb hukka! The place has it all. We ordered for lebanese platter and cheese spring rolls, both finger licking good! The capuccino cofee was average but the hukka made up for it! A must visit for all the crazy kolkatans looking for a break from chai break! |
 
Monkey Bar | Subham Agarwal | 777244 | 1.0 | 2016-12-01 13:05:10 | THIS PLACE IS PATHETIC

I ATE THE PANEER KHICHDI AND I AND MY FRIEND BOTH ¬†HAD A TERRIBLE INFECTION AFTER HAVING THIS. I THINK THEIR COOKING STANDARDS ARE VERY LOW.

WHEN I CALLED THEM TO SAY THAT I HAD A TERRIBLE INFECTION AFTER HAVING YOUR FOOD THEY ¬†HAD NO ANSWER.

I HAVE ALSO PUT UP A COMPLAIN AT FOOD AND QUALITY STANDARDS DEPARTMENT AGAINST THEM,

I SUGGEST NO ONE SHOULD GO THERE AT ALL. |
 
Monkey Bar | Risshe Malhotra | 31063007 | 4.5 | 2016-11-29 22:39:12 | Amazing food lovely ambience, joy is one of the best ppl he makes you feel special and the service is out of the world. Centrally located... |
 
Monkey Bar | Reetuparna Dutta | 1190721 | 4.5 | 2016-11-28 17:24:05 | Great place good food and good atmosphere. Loved the drinks as well ordered the manga with absolut and hot wings and loaded nachos with chicken . Everything was top notch. |
 
Monkey Bar | Kirti Agarwal | 16014301 | 3.0 | 2016-11-28 15:30:12 | I think it is one of the over rated places..the service was ok..music was very sad n sheesha not dat great...although ambience was good..but such a brand it is..der is an expectation bar which it disappoints to a great extent. |
 
Monkey Bar | Amrita Ghosh | 33949647 | 4.0 | 2016-11-26 20:51:37 | Want to dine with a view of Victoria memorial, step in here, which interiors n amazing food, gud classics as music and a lovely crowd, one cn spend hours here dining n wining. Food: chicken nachos is a good quantity. Mediterranean platter a lovly combo of flavors n great taste. Pizzas are thin crust n perfect. Drinks are innovative, I tried mamas girl & mojitos. Its one a litl higher side on the pocket but not exorbitant. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sanjiv Sood | 186102 | 4.5 | 2016-11-26 07:39:01 | The ‚ÄòMonkey Bar‚Äô Kolkata Avatar is a welcome addition to it's watering hole map and what an experience it metes out! Located in the heart of the city (Camac Street) with a huge and lofty space, it exudes a comfort zone feel. The visual delight of the interior space couples well with a spectacular view of the Kolkata skyline from the restaurant.¬†

The cream de la cr√®me among the restaurant‚Äôs USP's is the outdoor seating arrangement of about 5-6 tables. Although open to air, yet it is air-conditioned to beat the muggier months. Incidentally during the clement months it would be a pronounced experience to soak in Kolkata‚Äôs mild winters. The corner verandah serves hookah for the y-generation and for those who love to smoke with their tipple it is a rather comfortable space. I loved the incipient November chill all through the evening in the outdoor! It would be an idyllic place all through the wintery months to soak in the chilled weather.

Though I am not a cocktail loving person, I ventured out to try some of their swinging concoctions. First shot was the famed Manga.

Sweet and Tangy Vodka based cocktail, it had an all desi flavour burst from the Aam Panna as the main base with its signature cumin flavour to follow. It comes in a kullar shaped glass with etched in a typical Hinglish font that sets the tone for a fusion evening. 
Next, was the more stylized ‚ÄòMad Men‚Äô a Bourbon base with Coffee Orange and a whiff of Rosemary spray, which, I really liked and got myself a double dose.

 
 

Getting headier, I tried out the Copper Monkey, lo and behold but predictably it was in a copper mug. I quite liked the passion fruit flavour and the hint of mint in it worked well.

¬†

Although christened as ‚ÄòMonkey Bar‚Äô one would be rather surprised to see a super array of fusion food alongwith some very innovative desi leaning twisters. One look at the menu and I was instantly attracted to the Laal Maas Phulka Tacos, Radish cake bites for its novelty, Mobar Caramelized Pork ribs for its slow cooking and the Butterfly Chicken for the signature shells. 
The Laal Maas in the Phulka Tacos was juicy and well done, served on a ¬†Bao Stand for appeal as well as to function as a 'hold on'.  The meat was unique in flavour and spiced up enough to support its Laal Maas Status! 

 

The radish /mooli cake bites were indeed a experience though one really cannot make out if radish is used as the main filling ingredient unless told. The Tempura batter and the black bean sauce make up for the frunchy bite and flavour of the Radish bites.

 

The caramelized rib was succulent and smokey, living up the 6-hour slow cooked traditional method. So was it's house sauce quite zesty and lip smacking. 

 

The Butterfly Chicken was perhaps the only dish, which I would give the pass, though a visual delight again. I was lead to believe or was expecting a Butter Chicken filling. Maybe that is a good idea too.

Overall this place is not all just ambience, though that feeling is certainly overwhelming and sets up the mood. The service, food and the liquid chemistry in the cocktails are commendable too.

Monkey Bar | Kaustav Nayak | 1276373 | 5.0 | 2016-11-25 09:43:48 | With its French windows giving a glimpse of both the Victoria Memorial as well as the Howrah Bridge, the ambient lighting, great music, brick walls, a gorgeous skylight, a section that projects black and white motion picture and an apparently messy but ultimately symmetric seating arrangement that will please the OCD in you, Monkey Bar is hands down the best looking place in town. The ambiance, crowd and the location itself (9th floor of the Fort Knox building in Camac Street) itself demands a high rating. But it outdoes itself in the food department as well.¬†

The tiger beef is an instant classic. Perfectly cooked and just the right amount oily, this is a dish that I will highly recommend. The chettinad chicken samosas on the other hand flattered to deceive, definitely not worth the high price. Reddy's chicken popcorn though is a whole different story : small pieces of chicken fried with curry leaves, ¬†sesame, coconut shreds and a concoction of south Indian spices.¬†The name that will pique your interest however is the butter chicken khichudi. Bengali style sticky rice cooked amalgamated with Punjabi style chicken butter masala, this is a dish that has sharp flavors very well attuned for the Indian tongue. I absolutely loved it! 4 small cups containing curd, ghee, pickle and papad are given as accompaniments.¬†
¬†

And just everything else, their dessert section is more than competent too. While the snicker bar with its milk chocolate ganache on a crunchy almond base and a chocolate cake below may feel a tad too sweet, they provide a coffee ice cream to go with it and together the balance is delectable. The gondhoraj lime tart was more in my wheelhouse : the tangy lime curd really stood out. If I have to recommend one among these two I'd say take a leap of faith, ditch the always reliable chocolate and go for the tart.¬†

Here's to next time. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pratik Sensarma | 10848301 | 5.0 | 2016-11-22 20:50:17 | A too good place to b with your friends...had been there some days before...services are good...and ambience... Wat a place... After a long time had been to such an awesome place like this... One could have a marvelous view of the city Kolkata... Specially our Victoria memorial and cathedral Church...the foods are very tasty ...starting from Manga , tiger beef, tikki of joye to other cocktails  everything was perfectly made and served. Then lastly the desserts...the chocolate cake mainly... Was the best... Really had an too good time..keep it up guys  :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Anusreea Paul | 2257306 | 4.5 | 2016-11-21 12:13:39 | The famous brand is finally here in Kolkata. It's been three months since they opened doors on Camac Street and there's been no looking back for them :)
Had the opportunity to visit the place thanks to a bloggers meet. This is the brain child of chef Manu Chandra, the team, the food is crafted by him. The place epitomizes awesomeness in every inch. The place is big, read huge!! The huge old school windows lead you to stare at the city landscape with wide open eyes. They have an open seating arena, high rise chairs and comfortable sofas to choose from. They serve alcohol and hookah. They even arrange for sundowners on wintry afternoons, for you to sip on their lavish cocktails and enjoy the sun going down. The Victoria Memorial and the Howrah bridge are visual delights. They have their pub rules hence it is better to read them up and visit!
The crafted menu for the afternoon:

**Drinks**

Copper Monkey: Served in a copper vessel with a ¬†chunk of orange came this cocktail, whiskey based.

Manga: The ever famous drink, vodka based, a concoct of vodka and mango pulp.

Hipster Smash: Smacking name, and a refreshing drink! The array of colors are incredible. Mix of watermelon juice, a huge chunk of frozen watermelon and vodka.

Old Fashioned on Camac: The name might sound synonymous with rum but it is a whiskey based cocktail.

**Food**

Kerala Red Rice: A vegetarian and a non-vegetarians' delight! Thick red rice mixed with southern spices. It's spicy, it's crunchy, and it's tangy!!

Tiger Beef: The best, best, best beef is served here!! A bowlful of spicy meaty delight!! The shredded, well cooked, perfectly spiced beef served as the best chakna with the cocktails. Quite filling, good in quantity. Must order and highly recommended.

Butterfly Chicken: The outer coatings are designed like butterflies. Fried to perfection, oil less, the butterfly winged shaped cups are visual delights. Filled inside the cups are shredded chicken mixed in a nice sauce. Recommended for the sheer taste, intensity of the dish, and the efforts behind the perfect butterfly wings!

Shammi Sliders: These little burgers are lovely to look at. They do not fill you up completely yet leave you quite satisfied. The minced meat patties are perfect and there's no saucy drips. You actually do not mess yourself up eating this. Accompanied with some house special fries served inside a cute monkey bar wrapper.

Tikki of Joy: Quite a big hit down south, they decided to include it in their Kolkata menu as well. Huge chunks of bhetki frie to perfection. Served with onion rings and mint chutney. Crispy, ample fish in every mouthful, not oily at all.

Lal Maas Phulka Tacos: even sized parathas half rolled like rolls, filled with minced juicy meat. The meat is tender and you would feel like you are eating a roll, Kolkata style!!

**Desserts**

Gondhoraj Lime Tart: Tad a bit too bitter if eaten without the entire chunk. The idea is take a bit of the biscuit base, the creme, the lemon curd, the pistachio cake, and the raspberry sugared petals. And you could keep eating that and stare into the dreamy wintry sky line. But make sure to get a window seat..:)

Old Monkey Signature Chocolate Cake: What is a chocolate if it does not make you high!!! Well, this one sure does...a huge chunk of chocolate bar sprinkled with praline and caramel sauce. Served with a little scoop of ice cream...aaahhh never felt better!!¬†

Guys, agar aap Monkey Bar nahi gaye to please jaldi jaiye...it's waiting for you!! The coolest place in town to rock and roll. Try their karaoke nights or their usual dining hours, you will not be disappointing!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Suruchi Bhawsinghka | 1140387 | 3.0 | 2016-11-21 09:59:22 | The amount of tax,service charge vat, and wat not they are adding is insane.I have been to so many resto ,trust me this place is not worth it.I would rather sit in a five-star hotel lounge to spend around 5k between 4 ppl. If you leave aside the taxes you would always want to visit this place .Loved d simple decor(specially the huge windows ) perfect place to chill with friends and enjoy your drink.Snacks are average .Guys pls check ur taxes ...u r being unreasonable !!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Prarthana Roy | 1683183 | 3.5 | 2016-11-20 21:42:56 | Firstly , very much overpriced ! But fell in love with their decor and view .. food is overpriced according to their portion and most importantly they don't taste sound to be priced that much ! And coming to tax .. 1000 bucks ?! U will surely be left with a whole in ur pocket .. recommended for once , strictly ! |

Monkey Bar | Dhawal Pratap SIngh | 442772 | 3.5 | 2016-11-14 14:34:01 | The place has excellent ambience and definitely scores well on the food quality. However, the portions are really small adding on to the already heavy cost. Instead of 1500 for 2, its a place where you will incur Rs1500 per person. Plus the taxes are a lot on the pocket. Our regular bill of Rs 4800 had Rs2000 worth of taxes amounting to a total of Rs 6800! Paying 40% tax on top of my bill is not something I was looking forward to. |
 
Monkey Bar | Supriya Baid | 34842096 | 5.0 | 2016-11-13 20:55:15 | One of the best ambience i have ever seem in kolkata! Fabulous üëå great crowd. Good servers. Well maintained. Lovely presentation of food. Hookah love üíï keep it up guys ‚úå |
 
Monkey Bar | Shruti Keshri | 12428511 | 1.0 | 2016-11-08 22:26:50 | Pathetic place, the food quantity is so less, waiters don't understand anything, once you order the order only comes when you die hungry. We waited for  bill for almost 14 mins and then left, the waiter came running out to get the bill, and top of that the bill was wrong, they charged us for we didn't order also.

Over priced, lazy, pathetic place. Never visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | The Calcutta Foodie | 36569739 | 4.5 | 2016-11-08 11:14:50 | Monkey bar is the newest attraction in town and rightly so, talking about interiors the biggest hit is the huge Windows showing the skyline of Calcutta, it's a breathtaking view from the 9th floor. 

The menu is quite innovative and the concoctions in terms of the cocktails are pretty darn good.

The food doesn't disappoint at all the butterfly chicken was crispy and juicy which is very rare a combination and the pork ribs had a smokey barbecue flavour to them and were very, very soft. 

The place is slightly expensive, but, with that ambience and quality, it's hardly an issue. |
 
Monkey Bar | Ms_WalkingShoes | 1193155 | 4.5 | 2016-11-07 18:24:29 | Read d reviews on Zomato n planned to pop over to dis place.
The interiors..ambience...music..crowd n d staff is absolutely perfect.
The view is jus mindblowing n d breeze is so soothing.
We ordered Prawn Pil Pil which was yum..
The Beef Pickle and the Pork Sausages were a bit disappointing.
We had two beers and a virgin mojito.
D thing dat was bit disappointing was dat our bill was 2368Rs...out of which 535Rs was jus all kinda tax.
Overall this place is one of d best plc to hangout around. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rishav Dey | 193398 | 4.0 | 2016-11-07 14:01:53 | Six of us landed up at Monkey Bar on a Saturday evening. It was a nightlife hotspot at 19:30 hours already and we had to wait almost 40 minutes before we could be seated. We were ushered in and given the offer of crowding around the bar which we accepted.
The ambiance was great. Music was good and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Making a conversation wasn't the easiest thing to do but at places like this that is quite expected. 
We kicked off the evening with a portion of Loaded Nachos, 4 helpings of Pack a Punch, one Old Fashioned on Camac with bourbon and one Mama's Girl with Absolut. The last two we had to settle for because Toast to Calcutta couldn't me made due to lack of availability of gin. The nachos were appetizing and I liked my old fashioned with bourbon but the accompanying almond biscotti was too sweet for me. The pack a punch was good but the Mama's Girl was not appreciated by any one.
The Aam Admi Eggs went down well with me. It reminded me of the bhel puri walas and their chutneys. The eggs were soft but firm. It made me crave a bit for the soft, gooey and runny yolk. The Hispter Smash was nice but the Tipsy Sherbet was quite interesting for me because I have always wondered how alcohol would blend with rose syrup and Mo Bar did a wonderful job. The Copper Monkey was a bit like a fruity mint julep but I did like it. The Not so Vanilla was not quite my kind of cocktail with the creamy texture so I exchanged that for the Hipster Smash with a friend. The best cocktail according to me was by far the Mad Men. All the flavours combined really well and complimented each other beautifully. Coffee and orange always work well but the subtle rosemary was a delightful addition. 
The duck pita pockets were great. Oriental flavours in between a pita was an unusual combination but the pita seemed to go quite well with the duck in five spice and the hoisin sauce. The Kerala Beef Fry was nice but I would have loved to have it with Malabar parotta instead of the bread they served. The smoked chicken pizza was decent too. 
The service was very good. There was a period in between when we were very unhappy with the excruciatingly slow service but our server was extremely apologetic about it and cited the reason of a busy weekend evening for the barmen. It was understandable as far as I was concerned. The value for money is perhaps a bit on the lower side and I would say Mo Bar is a moderately expensive place. The food was mostly good. The drinks too were mostly very good. And I couldn't get enough of the Mad Men. So I will return for the Mad Men and to try the beef bulgogi, tiger beef, Goan chrizo pav, baked brie and prawn ghee roast. Recommended if one doesn't mind spending a bit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sharan Bansal | 394157 | 5.0 | 2016-11-06 18:14:14 | Amazing new York style ambience in Kolkata. Great hospitality and service! We had an awesome Sunday lunch with friends over champagne , rum punch and beer ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sahil Islam | 1001945 | 5.0 | 2016-11-05 00:53:16 | Lovely place with nice decor ...... The pricing was excellent given the quality of the food even for non drinkers it is a not to be missed spot loved the duck pita pocket and snicker bar |
 
Monkey Bar | Harsh Agarwal | 615445 | 4.5 | 2016-11-03 22:40:49 | Food, decor and ambience is top notch. Kolkata has got a Gem restaurant and bar. The view and seating is made for each other.

For the egg lovers-"Aam aadmi eggs. Sheer brilliant dish. Must try if you visit.

The staff needs to be a little polite and polished. Lack hospitality and softness. If they can improve upon this, it will be no doubt the finest joint in the city.

Will surely visit again. |
 
Monkey Bar | Santanu Adhikary | 31601287 | 4.5 | 2016-11-02 15:01:09 | Awesome ambience. ..mesmerising view of our beloved quintessential kolkata. ..love the taste of butterfly chicken and nachos with whisky. .. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul | 20537314 | 4.0 | 2016-10-31 13:45:15 | Great food, smooth shisha and pleasant staff at a great location. The food served was fresh and tasty. Though the open area for shisha is a little congested. This is a perfect alternative to bar exchange since the staff is very pleasant. Had an outing with 8 of team mates on October 25, costed 7.5 k excluding alcohol. Will be my preferred location for after work outings as long as the staff is pleasant. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pooja Marwaha | 1981882 | 4.0 | 2016-10-30 23:11:30 | One of the new places opened in Calcutta. This place has a great view of the city with good music. When I say good music, I mean music in the background and you can hear the person sitting opposite to you. The service is spot on. The servers attend to you first and do not chit chat in a corner. Now the food, ordered a farmers pizza which was good enough for an evening snack. The best thing that happened during the evening was the hookah. It was so smooth yet gave the kick. After a very long had really good hookah. The price pinch is moderate too. Would definitely visit more often now. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Agrawal | 1902980 | 4.5 | 2016-10-30 00:43:02 | Since its opening, have been there couple of times already. The evening view of the city is definitely one of the the ups of the place.¬†
The ambience is awesome and the right kind of classy touch interiors makes you want to come n relax with friends.¬†
The mocktails were good, and some dishes mentioning special mention are Chilli Cheese dragons, Med platter, Falafel Sliders and Mobar Laksa.¬†
Thanks Avantika for bringing the Monkey to town. :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Divya Khettry | 1930204 | 4.0 | 2016-10-29 12:09:30 | Finally the Monkey swings East! Must day amazing ambience and view. Drinks were great too the only thing I didn't like here was the food its a little average. I also loved the music all my fav tracks were played. |
 
Monkey Bar | Tushar Goyal | 1881622 | 4.5 | 2016-10-29 10:47:35 | Unluckily I ended up to the place on a Thursday and it was a dry day there, but the food was phenomenal . The moment you see the menu you want to try everything .

We ordered loaded nacho was very good , beet and orange salad which was ok , kimchi baby potatoes is a must try.
For the mains I ordered paneer kichdi which was good and the soulful bowl chilly paneer was good too. 

Going to go again for the non- veg very soon . |
 
Monkey Bar | Komal Agarwal | 34017613 | 3.5 | 2016-10-27 19:38:37 | The only good part about this place was the ambience and picturesque settings. Food is nothing worth mentioning. The spaghetti pasta was bad. Spring rolls & nachos were okay. Among the drinks, I really liked the Virgin Mangaa. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pragya | 1712349 | 3.0 | 2016-10-26 16:50:18 | Ambience - Good

Monkey Bar | Sumitra Sharma | 34680967 | 4.0 | 2016-10-25 11:54:10 | hi,
Was there for lunch.ambience is very good and the moment I entered it felt like its a lovely place for a winter lazy afternoon date. very clean.As we went in a large group the service was a bit slow.I hope as the restaurant ages it will be sorted out.butter chicken khichdi was good.smoothies and drink were also good.I had tried prawn which was also very tasty.I loved the interior,very classy specially the open area to sit.should try once.

Monkey Bar | Chandramouli Daga | 15803042 | 4.0 | 2016-10-24 20:41:36 | A sensational space with a terrific view of the Calcutta skyline. While it is expensive and the cocktails might not cater to everyone, the food is experimantally delicious while the service is admirable. 

Happening! And how! |
 
Monkey Bar | Moumita Das Talukdar | 343640 | 4.0 | 2016-10-24 20:01:03 | Visited this place at Fort Knox building 9th floor- the new outlet to party with friends. Gorgeous interiors and a stellar reputation as a chain we went there with high expectations and we were satisfied.Spectacular view with good music and awsum food. Innovative cocktails , lipsmacking pork and beef dishes.A must try joint. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anurag Jaiswal | 1778047 | 4.5 | 2016-10-24 18:14:19 | Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox building. The food & service are excellent. Ambiance is awesome. Per pax-Rs.1000 with drinks (inclusive of taxes) |
 
Monkey Bar | Sanjay Bhowmik | 29528004 | 4.0 | 2016-10-23 23:36:21 | I think I would rate this place 95% purely for the ambience and the view....the truly quintessential bar and cafe where you can have an awesome conversation at an awesome side table with an awesome view of the metropolis named Kolkata that I am yet to see anywhere in this city....truth be told, I was bedazzled and enamoured by the view....a whole 6/5!!!

Then comes the hard reality....for the few drinks (7), couple of coffee and a few bites, it was almost ‚Çπ4.2k....time to pay for the view!!!!....maybe a tinge more so 3.5/5....but the few hours spent are worth sitting there provided the company / conversation is good....

Nothing to write home about the food taste, just an avg 3.5/5

In the evening they have a good lighting set up and inspite of the crowd, every table and it's occupants had their own space and not intruded upon....it didn't feel cluttered like other such hallmark Kolkatan joints....would have gone for a 4.5/5 but they totally managed to screw that up with thumping music, which could have been easily done through the softer and low volume lounge music!!!...killed the evening ambience....if the idea was to attract the vibrant gen then they missed the fact that there were a whole lot of couples and a few bunch who were engrossed in their own conversation and seemed a bit irritated with the thumping bass....so here's a 3/5 for ruining the awesome layout and view....

If I would ever come again, it would be for the view and the window seats....but guys, do get some class in the music, the environment should provide for individual space, the layout, lighting, setting and ambience are awesome but your music settings are truly questionable, at least this time round!!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Gupta | 29595954 | 3.0 | 2016-10-23 14:58:41 | I didnt have the food since i wanted north indian cuisine and they dnt serve the same where as Zomato says they serve north indian.... ambience was excellent.... |

Monkey Bar | Munmun Banerjee Ghosh | 13780291 | 5.0 | 2016-10-21 09:22:56 | Excellent food!Good cocktails.Even better music.And the best part of Monkey Bar is the view.Perfect blend to fall in love with the city,all over again.Must-visit!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sunanda Ghosh | 2720210 | 4.0 | 2016-10-20 12:21:51 | The newest addition to Camac Street, Monkey bar holds the promise of becoming one of the coolest hangouts for GenY. Situated on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building, it offers a panoramic view of the city through huge glass windows and what's more there's even arrangement for outdoor seating. The decor is charming and an awesome background score makes the ambience perfect for chilling out with your friends over great food and drinks. Firstly we ordered a butterfly chicken and duck pita pockets. The chicken was delicious and crispy tossed with bell peppers, chilli flakes and stuffed in crunchy butterfly shells and the duck meat marinated with spices and packed inside soft pita bread created fireworks in our mouths. We also went for a smoked chicken, chicken salami and harissa pizza which was superb, to say the least. There was another Hearty bowl, a heartwarming chicken broth with bean sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, flat noodles and bokchoy sprinkled with chilli oil. We finished off with Mobar Sundae Sandwich, an ice cream cake with nuts layered with nutella and tutti fruti. We also tried their hookah and the shisha is really good and strong. The service is more of less..efficient and the staff polite..but the pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side. They recently acquired their bar license, so would love to drop in again for a taste of their cocktails! |
 
Monkey Bar | Pamela Nandi | 2821382 | 3.0 | 2016-10-20 01:06:16 | No doubt this place has an amazing ambience with an indoor and outdoor seating area styled in the form of british pub, but food and service is very very poor.¬† We went on ashtami night with friends, they took about an hour to prepare the chicken stacked as saslik to grill it. Once served, the dish was just tasteless. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sunrita Sarkar | 804376 | 5.0 | 2016-10-18 22:44:36 | Hi, if you love Calcutta , good music(and by good music I mean led zeppelin and pink flyod and classics as such ) and a brilliant view of Calcutta, this is the place to be. 

We ordered a pack up punch, Sangria and a 100 pipers based cocktail. All three were pretty different and pretty well made. 

We didn't order any food as we were so engrossed in the decor and view. 

The hospitality was brilliant. 

Do give it a visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Aritra Roy | 145459 | 4.5 | 2016-10-17 22:31:23 | Already visited twice in such a short span of opening its doors in Kolkata, Monkey Bar has been fabulous on both occasions. Situated on the top floor of Fort Knox, it provides a magnificent view of the Kolkata skyline with Victoria Memorial, St Pauls Cathedral, Hooghly bridge and the 42 which is the tallest building here.

The food has been great and is presented in a unique way. Ordered Chilli Cheese dragons, Mac and cheese croquettes, Butterfly chicken and Chicken Chimichurri on the first time along with Mangaa mocktail. On the repeat, we ordered Mobar caramel ribs, Tiger beef, Reddys popcorn chicken alongwith a Smoked chicken pizza. In drinks, we had copper monkey , house made ginger beer with a couple of KF ultras.

However special mention must go to the desserts, Snicker bar is just too good while Nolen gur creme brulee was delicious.
They have a small open air area for hookah as well. The service is prompt and the ambience is quite relaxing. The bar looks pretty while the music changes over time with comforting tracks during evening to partying ones as the night progresses on.

Overall, the Kolkata gastropub scene is proud to have Monkey bar in its lineup. Hope it gets better from here.Cant wait to visit soon again :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Rupsha Bhadra | 606325 | 4.5 | 2016-10-16 14:33:22 | Monkey bar in Delhi is a location that is a part of some very special memories so I had really high expectations from its Calcutta counterpart. It certainly did not disappoint. We ordered loaded chicken nachos, the butter chicken kichdi, smoked chicken pizza and others. The butter chicken khichdi was really impressive. So were the cocktails Maanga and Copper monkey. A little on the higher side when it comes to the pocket pinch, monkey bar did live up to all the expectations. And the view is just fantastic. |
 
Monkey Bar | Madhurya Sarkar | 6309371 | 5.0 | 2016-10-16 12:11:35 | Just loved it.
The ambiance, the playlist, the skyline view, the staff management, the food and everything is just superb of this pub. This is located in the 9th floor of Knox building opposite to Urban desi. We visited late afternoon but the best time would be to hit this place in the evening. This can be an ideal place to go a date with your partner :)
The view of St. Paul's Cathedral, Victoria Memorial and Hooghly Bridge adds flavour to their ambiance.
Coming to food we had kingfisher premium beer, chicken wings and chocolate lava cake. All of the dishes were value for money. Overall had an excellent experience.
Coming back soon :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Syed Murtaza Jafar | 32607152 | 5.0 | 2016-10-16 04:52:57 | Ok, so same night we visited The Great Booze Story and Monkey Bar, and I'll say Monkey Bar won big time. Just opposite Urban Desi (will visit soon), good collection of music, courteous and attentive staff, this is one venue that you would want to visit again. The ambience, the view of the The Victoria Memorial is just a sight to look at. Safe to say, I'll be coming back to this place soon |
 
Monkey Bar | Preity | 27451267 | 4.5 | 2016-10-15 21:30:28 | Rare does it happen that you get good food at a bar and by the ambience of this place i expected nothing different..but to my surprise it was a very delightful experience..superbbbb food..good music, not too loud so you can chit chat with your friends..and very courteous staff..overall a very good experience..definitely coming back and soon... |

Monkey Bar | Sankha Sengupta | 1733759 | 4.0 | 2016-10-14 17:13:36 | Been there yesterday night. Had soft to you guys, you people just amazed me by your friendly hospitality.
Specialty thanks to Joy you made my evening remarkable. Monkey people should be proud to have a manager like you. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rashmi Adhikary | 31014016 | 4.5 | 2016-10-14 14:26:12 | We visited Monkey Bar on Saptami evening, and had a spectacular time. The ambience is lively, the music is great, the decor very impressive and the service commendable.  
Now coming to the sumptuous meal; an assortment of drinks - whiskey, tequila, rum, virgin mojita, espresso -  was ordered with starters being Butterfly Chicken and Chicken Chapli. Yes, Butterfly Chicken is a definitely worth a try. In the main course, there was Aunty Vinnie's Berry Pulao. Tiger Beef was so delicious that two more dishes were ordered; this is must-try for beef lovers. This is the first place in Kolkata that I see so many beef dishes being offered. Galouti Killer was the other beef dish ordered and equally palatable. I had Mee Goreng which is an Indonesian dish of spiced noodles and got it topped with chicken. 
Overall, it was a great experience in this newly-opened gastropub. |
 
Monkey Bar | Piyush Dalmia | 15726652 | 4.5 | 2016-10-13 20:42:49 | Another fab newbie in the city

Talk about the Ambience, Food, Service or the Decor, it excels in all

Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building at Camac Street, it offers a spectacular view of the city
 
The Decor and Seating Arrangements are well made 

They got a separate smoking area which is quite airy, and has ample seating space as well

Shisha was pretty decent and lasted quite a while

Now lets talk about the protagonist here

Nachos were crisp and loaded with cheese, the Platter was appealing and featured variety of items whereas the mocktails were on fleek 

But things which really caught our attention were Spaghetti and Paneer Khidchi

While the former was extremely tasty, the latter is a MUST have dish for sure

All in all, it was a happy dining experience for us |
 
Monkey Bar | Arpita Agarwal | 998579 | 4.5 | 2016-10-13 12:39:47 | A new place in town, much awaited. Great ambience! The view is also super!! Maybe they should have had a slightly larger rooftop area. Food is decent too. The nachos were pretty good. The Manga is a must try!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sharmistha Mukherjee | 722185 | 4.5 | 2016-10-12 06:49:58 | If you are in Calcutta and love the skyline and a few drinks to go along with it on a hot, rainy or crisp evening this is the place to be. Monkey Bar in Calcutta is done up beautifully and affords you a view of the Victoria Memorial, St Paul's Cathedral and the Hoogly Bridge. The have cocktails and food over and above what they offer in other cities. The hipster smash is delicious to say the least. As was the bourbon cocktail with almond bitters... |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohit Suryawanshi | 36318376 | 5.0 | 2016-10-11 18:11:29 | My favourite lalmass Takos ,Pizza and Delicious Chillie cheese Dragon.
The friendliness of the staff seems genuine. I have never seen such good customer service as I experienced. |
 
Monkey Bar | FOODBUFFS | 987893 | 4.0 | 2016-10-11 11:16:14 | Visited on Ashtami night.Even though it was a good crowd,we managed to get a table immediately,courtesy to the experienced and efficient management team.There is an open-air seating which mainly caters to people ordering hookah or going there for a puff.Indoor seating is quite large.
Decor is akin to a British pub.Upholstery is comfortable.What allures you are those French windows through which you can catch a great glimpse of the city skyline,from the ninth floor.In the evenings there is muted lighting.Ambience is quite good.We heard some good old day soft music but as the night grew,the DJ started giving groovy yet classy numbers.
Service is warm and polite but there was a lack of professionalism.We were giving the same food order to two or three different men at times.The servers,even though quite courteous,were not quite clearly conversant about the food and beverages,unless asked upon.Details or any recommendations/suggestions were not given on their own.They need to more vocal  and well informed about every detail of the food when the order is being placed.
PAN RASNA HOOKAH-strong flavour,no choking but the smoke was quite weak,unlike to our liking.It was smooth but the smoke didnot last for an hour.It wasnot worth the price charged.Not satisfied.
BUTTERFLY CHICKEN-tastewise quite impressive.Chicken morsels were soft and had a sweet tangy taste.The sauce was pretty good and spicy and the butterfly shells were crispy,the whole presentation looked lovely.Three butterflies were there.
REDDY'S CHICKEN POPCORN-Well this dish took us to South India.Moderately sized chicken morsels deep fried in a batter having a crisp crunchy texture and the taste was so consistent in southern flavours,it tasted good.Curry leaves flavour was predominant and we liked it a lot to go for a second order.
CHICKEN CHIMICHURI-Chicken was soft.They were skewed up but the flavours were quite bland,didnot stand up to our expectations.Not impressive at all,this dish needs improvement.
MEDITERRANEAN PLATTER-Mixed comments.It was great in some parts,not so great in others.Chickpea fries were not so good to taste,seemed a bit too fried where the chickpea stuffing was too less.The pita breads were nice,soft,fluffy,buttered and nicely grilled,tasted good.Hummus was in great quantity,tastewise perfect but the babaghanoush didnot stand out in taste.Cheese filo wraps tasted good.They  had soft spinach with gooey cheese inside wrapped in rice papers and fried.Overall a good dish,you can give it a try if Mediterranean cuisine is your calling.
OLD MONK(EY) CHOCOLATE CAKE-Good.Cake was melt in mouth soft and creamy.Consistency of cream was smooth,light and fluffy.The dessert was classy,superb and hence recommended.
Foodwise we were not that satisfied as much as we were with their cocktails!!
Their BOURBON LIIT,MAD MEN and MAMA'S GIRL were just bang on!The bartender did a great job.The blend was great,the liquor gave a great kick,courtesy the good mixing.They were well balanced in flavours and the ingredients of the drinks very well complimented each other.Spices and mint went well with vodka,and coffee with whisky surely made a great pair.
We also ordered Heineken,Ginger ale and fresh lime soda which was usual.
As far as price is concerned,it is too high for the food and some cocktails! Quantity of food is very less,so doesnot justify the price and tastewise it didnot make a good mark.The cocktails had a price tag which was same as most gastropubs having a good establishment cost,yet they were high.
This pub is a must visit,esp for their awsome cocktails.The gastronome part needs improvement to call it a fair gastropub.Will visit again for sure owing to the overall good experience that we had,a good hangout place and to try other cocktails and entr√©es. |
 
Monkey Bar | Garima Poddar | 2714062 | 3.5 | 2016-10-10 23:22:48 | The ambience n decor is nice..I had ordered fr a peach icetea n it was quite refreshing..the chilli cheese dragon was nt that impressive n lacking chilli..onion n capsicum basically the description was amazing bt it was no where near that..nachos was average..spaghetti in red sauce was again average..green thai curry was really nice n d best part was d dessert mobar sundae sandwhch it was like love at first bite |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohit Misra | 1561408 | 4.5 | 2016-10-10 11:32:08 | Monkey bar has lived upto the expectations. With crazy ambience and amazing service, it just became my favourite destination in town. Also on a special note, Ripon out there was brilliant with his service. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rima Dhara | 1796261 | 2.5 | 2016-10-09 20:08:51 | Nothing great... service is very bad... food is ok.. ambiance is good ... but as a whole coz of service of of the worst place I have ever been.... will not try again ‚òπÔ∏è chicken wasn't fresh... very bad experience ... |
 
Monkey Bar | Sreyashi M. | 10853321 | 4.5 | 2016-10-09 19:05:16 | Visited today for lunch, and a had a lovely time! 
I suggest you get a table by the windows. The Kolkata skyline will definitely make your visit even more memorable. 
We tried the Maanga cocktail (5 stars, peeps!) with the Tiger Beef. I suggest you try both. Succulent meat with the zing of your drink makes for some very happy (read: tipsy) people. 
For mains, we tried the Mobar burger and it was heavenly! The Naga pork soulful bowl was fabulous too! Portions are great, flavour is gorgeous and staff is super sweet and nice. 
I hope you maintain what you've got going so I can visit again! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sudipto Mitra | 2401672 | 3.5 | 2016-10-09 09:00:39 | Nice decor , awsum view of the cityscape and great cocktails . Food is good to average with a twist and may not be liked by all.
We ordered pitchers of pack a punch,mangaa amd mohjito and the first is the best.

We stuck with finger food only and ordered 
Mushroom bruschetta(good),prawn pil pil(gr8), chicken churi(avg) and tiger beef(gr8)
Rounded everything off with aunty berry pulao which was delicious
 This a typical gastro bar with foot tapping music which is too loud at times, we had to ask it to be turned down.

The service could have been bettet and there  was confusion while seating. We were waiting at the bar for our table to be ready but some other guests jumped on that

Oh forgot to mention a outing here will surely burn a whole in your pocket |
 
Monkey Bar | Vedant Kabra | 2240676 | 4.5 | 2016-10-09 08:47:40 | I went to monkey bar last night and I was pretty surprised. Read all the reviews and thoroughly analysed the place in my mind before I went there (it's what I do). 
The guy at the front desk (I believe he was the owner) was phenomenal. So welcoming, so easy going and so 'approachable'. The one at the front desk is the face of any restaurant. He told us we'll have to wait for 40, but we got a table in 20. Told us we'll have to share the table - but eventually we didn't have to. 
I think seating right outside the kitchen + bar worked for us. Didn't have to wait for the food (the cheese drum, nachos and mushroom + truffle oil pizza are INSANE). Ordered quite a bit on the liquor front - barring the martini everything else was really good (fun presentation too!) (including the ginger beer). We had heard so much about the desserts - total let down though (chocolava cake with mint ice cream was terrible I must confess - Mezzuna gets the big ups here). 
The staff was pretty alright (looked a little confused at times). 
Monkey bar must work on guest management (but it is only a few weeks old so it's okay). Thoroughly impressed with the ambience (trumps Mezzuna and all the other hot spots in the city several times over), food, booze and service. 
This place has my highest recommendation. |
 
Monkey Bar | Argha Basu | 1892606 | 5.0 | 2016-10-08 15:46:45 | If you want to impress your girlfriend or wife . Just take her there . Take your seat next to the glass wall and enjoy the panaromic view of the Victoria memorial, Vidyasagar Setu and the Howrah Bridge.

Monkey Bar | Puja Das | 36272619 | 4.5 | 2016-10-08 12:52:12 | Bookmarks . ¬†It's got an amazing atmosphere with outdoor and indoor seating. Despite going on the weekend it gets the right amount of crowd that makes it a very happening place. Music was really good. We wanted to try a new cocktail, so we went for the ¬†toast to calcutta which was a little different and tasted quite good. Food on the other hand was quite unique. 
service is also impressed us. ¬† ¬†

The place is a little hard to find. But overall it's a nice place for the weekend chill! |
 
Monkey Bar | Tejash | 15384381 | 1.5 | 2016-10-08 11:33:48 | Visited this place on 7th October with friends. We were a group of 11 but there is no place for such big group there.  The table we were given was ideal for 7 but we had to squeeze in.  Repeated request for chair felt to deaf ears till such time my friend pulled up the bar chair from the adjacent table. They have limited staff and one server was alloted to the tables.  Needless to say the service was pathetic and totally unacceptable. Our order for beer and ginger ale took 30 mins and after repeated reminders it arrived.  The food is average with limited option for Vegetarian. No one wants to eat "baigan pakora " or " vada pav" at such a place.  We were charged for one item that was ordered but not served. On pointing the same the server "argued" that we didn't realise but it was indeed served to us.  In no mood to hang around any more we just paid and left.  While waiting down for our car we met others who too were very disappointed with the place. 

This will be one of those places in kolkata that will soon be ticked off based on word or mouth and customer experience because of shabby service and attitude of the people who run it. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anshuman Jalan | 31752408 | 2.0 | 2016-10-08 00:20:08 | Good atmoshpere ! Average food for vegie lovers ! Place to chill and soak in the music and buzz around . Nothing home to write about the food . And weekend and holidays . aVOID as unable to give service due to rush |
 
Monkey Bar | Darshana Rampuria | 2855224 | 3.5 | 2016-10-05 11:34:14 | So finally visited Monkey Bar ! The ambience is good as compared to What we get to see in Kolkata.. but apart from that nothing spectacular and surely cannot be compared to the one in Mumbai ! The food is Too average . We had ordered the Nachos - this one was a disaster , pesto spaghetti ( penne pasta wasn't there!!) - yet again very bland and just not up to the mark . Though tempura and mezze platter was good BUT the Coconut ice cream Dessert was FABULOUS SO an extra 0.50 points for that !! Food needs to be worked upon , staff is courteous ! Best wishes .. hoping my next visit be better and with no complains ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sujan Das | 36218418 | 4.5 | 2016-10-03 14:04:44 | I went this place with my friends and I would say this was amazing and was full packed in the weekend without liquor. There ambiance was very good and the music they place is also very nice . There drinks where also very good . They smoking and non smoking area also which was the best part of this place. Good place to spend with your friends. As we been to many other bars but I love this place as they have place to sit and there service was also excellent. They where pack but still there people know how to attend the gust which was very good in this bar. Pocket friendly and staff was excellent smiling and they working and they suggest also if you are new to this place and don't know what to order. I would suggest everyone for this place and sure you will be in love with this place. I basically tried everything on the menu (food and beverage), and yes it is all worth every penny
, I m fan of there menu and food, really enjoyed.¬†

Monkey Bar | Soul !! | 32140714 | 4.5 | 2016-10-03 08:50:51 | In a word, wonderful. We been to Delhi Monkey but this is the best one with wonderful view. 
One thing we really missed the Foosball) 
But no matter we had great time, fantastic food, we order lot many things forget the name but pizza and starters are yumm, drinks are also really nice
Staff were very welcoming too.

So keep good work guys !! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sarat | 8743511 | 3.0 | 2016-10-03 01:16:59 | ambience is good.. was excited to reach the place.. view n open air is also impressive.. u get a glimpse of the Victoria memorial
Although can't talk about the cocktails(coz we wet on 2nd oct, dry day), but we had the copper monkey mocktail and a ginger beer, we were very happy with both
But sadly food was extremely disappointing.. taste as well as quality is not upto the mark.. ordered the much talked about chicken butterfly, too sweet, no flavour of chicken n tasted Lyk beans on toast
Second ordered the spicy tomato spaghetti, worst I hav ever had, tasted like Maggi with tomato
Butter chicken khichadi was good,,, good innovation
Snickerbar, dessert, was well mind blowing if u hav a sweet tooth.. very nice and balanced taste
But the whole dining experience was not satisfactory |
 
Monkey Bar | Nikita Ramgarhia | 903737 | 2.5 | 2016-10-01 10:11:42 | An over hyped place.
The only plus points are the ambience and the service.
The hookah is average and food simply disappoints.
The vada pao is good.
The Mac and cheese croquettes have peas in them..like who does peas with cheese and Mac..
Too bad with the experimentation guys..
And the potato rackett is also very bland.
Galauti is average..
You guys are better in other cities I have heard..so pls improve in Kolkata |
 
Monkey Bar | Bindu | 36159071 | 3.5 | 2016-09-29 00:55:19 | At last chef manu chandra with his concept of monkey bar has entered in Kolkata.but sorry to say the food and service has dissapointed on comparison with the monkey bars in bombay and bangalore.
Need to check before its too late its my first experience but once more will love to try so that they can still improvise. |
 
Monkey Bar | Harish Todi | 1076456 | 2.0 | 2016-09-28 00:28:12 | The place is worst ever in all places that I do visit. What it seems from outside is not at all from inside. It's totally a different one and thats very disappointing for me. The hookah was so bad that I just left it after once. It was all a waste of money for me and that too a huge waste as it is very costly as per their brand name , but it's sad to say that it couldn't carry it'd brand name at all. |
 
Monkey Bar | Hardik Daga || Kolkata Epicurean | 9516701 | 4.0 | 2016-09-26 23:52:06 | Location-Fort knox building(9th floor),Camac street.

Finally "Monkey bar" has opened its gate to kolkata.After establishing itself in Mumbai,Delhi and Bangalore its opening in kolkata was much awaited.This place is totally a fresh take on gastrobar culture.As we entered we were totally astonished with the beauty of this place.The best part about this place was the swanky interiors and the dazzling view.The menu was mouthwatering and creation of one of the finest chef Manu Chandra.But along with whole lot of positive aspects this place has its negative side too and that is its service and price.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is extremely calm and soothing.The interiors are extremely high-toned.The place is divided into two sections(Smoking and Non Smoking area)which is appreciated.And atlast for this segment,we can bet that this place has the best view in comparison to any of the eateries in Kolkata.

Service-We were extremely disappointed with the service at this place.The staff was extremely confused with our seating.They took about 15 minutes to make us sit and also the table on which we were seated was already reserved by someone due to which we have to change our table in between.We also have to urge them many a times to serve us water and take the order for the food.But on the other side we saw that the staff was trained very well with the dishes and helped us to choose the right dishes according to our starvation.

Food-The food at this place was good in taste but what astonished us the most was their presentation,it was just praise-worthy.We had-
1:Med platter
2:Spicy panner bhurji buns
3:Chilli cheese dragons

Among them our favourite was "Med platter".We also had sheesha at this place which we find extremely expensive.It cost us around 800+taxes.

Food-4/5
Service-3/5
Ambiance-4.5/5

This place is a must visit for experiencing its Ambiance and food oresentation.üòÉüòÉ |
 
Monkey Bar | Ritwika Pal | 172912 | 4.0 | 2016-09-26 10:27:27 | Woo another gastropub in town, I was super excited to explore this new place. Unfortunately they not yet started with alcohol. But yes for compensation they have this Non alcoholic beer in their menu card. Which is more like a ginger ale.¬†
Food is awesome we tried Sticky Korean Chicken Wings and Prawn Pil Pil for which is can give 5/5. |

Monkey Bar | Vikash Kumar Singh | 32056738 | 2.0 | 2016-09-25 23:21:32 | Went to this place on 25th of September. The best part of this hotel is the view of Victoria + Vidyasagar Setu. Food is ok types. Service needs to improve. Didnt like that much. |
 
Monkey Bar | Shakshi Bajaj | 34222951 | 4.0 | 2016-09-25 21:50:03 | Had recently visited the place.  Ambience was really good.  Soothing music and ample space worked well for me.  All the people were very courteous and response was very quick. We ordered nachos,  potato with rachlette cheese and pizza.  The food was yummmm. We asked for out of the menu toppings for pizza and they were more than happy to serve.  It was a pleasant experience. |
 
Monkey Bar | Samrat Banerjee | 984442 | 3.0 | 2016-09-25 18:48:36 | Visited the place on 24Sep. A mix of pro's and cons. Remarkably expensive, considering service is yet to reach premium standards. Yet to get a bar license, staff seems confused about where to seat you if you walk in as a couple. While the outdoor sitting layout is nice, it's primarily used as a hookah space by boisterous youngsters, and the seating layout is remarkably cramped. Service also is a minus here with the server not asking or serving water if not called to do so. Portions are quite small against the charges. Chicken Chimichuri was good, folks lovers which was 3 cutlets of bhekti coated and fried was ok. The mushroom pizza was definitely a let down. With 2 soft drinks the tab came to ‚Çπ1650+. Not worth a revisit soon. |
 
Monkey Bar | Abhishek Agarwal | 2897244 | 3.5 | 2016-09-25 03:13:53 | Was on the bucket list since it opened... So
We ordered a hookah but it failed my expectations... We tried out the tacos which was really nice... Service was on the slower side.... Definitely a lot to improve..
But then having ur food wit hookah nd Victoria memorial to look over.. The view is breathtaking..
But u need to live up to the name...
Hope to b back soon.... Nd wish to see a Better Trained Monkeyüëç |

Monkey Bar | Shourya Sengupta | 2357486 | 4.5 | 2016-09-23 21:51:57 | Brilliant food! Loved the wide choice of meat. Please keep up the good work! Look forward to having the Galouti Killer, next time since it was not available. |
 
Monkey Bar | Siddhi Newatia | 3761881 | 3.0 | 2016-09-23 21:24:05 | Amazing ambience..very spacious, drinks menu could Hav had more variety..hated the mangaa drink..i found it too sour..the pizza and chilli cheese dragons were good. |
 
Monkey Bar | Harsh Bathwal | 1481844 | 3.5 | 2016-09-21 23:42:47 | Visited here for the first time. The food menu is different from what you come across usually in other restaurants. I think it's a perfect date spot as it has a beautiful Victoria building's view which looks amazing at night. Also the music was superb.
Pocket pinch : 600-700 per head. ( Food and mocktail) |
 
Monkey Bar | Shikha Ojha | 2112728 | 4.5 | 2016-09-18 01:48:05 | Amazing decor and awesome food. They had an outdoor sitting too which had a big screen playing Mickie and Minnie black and white cartoon synchronized with the songs being played. The cost is on the higher side but if you want to pamper yourself or people you love, this is the place to be. The amazing view is icing on the cake. |
 
Monkey Bar | Utsav Agarwal | 31137221 | 1.5 | 2016-09-17 22:49:13 | There is a difference in Bangalore wen it compares to Kolkata one , seriously don't no d reason but it needs to upgrade it very soon as in Bangalore. 
Specifically, the property is pretty old for a brand like dis 
According to me Monkey bar is just not another lounge but a more of a culture which in itself |
 
Monkey Bar | Arnav Jhunjhunwala | 22857974 | 5.0 | 2016-09-16 21:28:37 | The best place to hangout now. Food quality is excellent and many of the dishes aren't available anywhere in Kolkata. The key lime pie is unbelievable and a must have each time you go. |
 
Monkey Bar | Tanya Sen | 496614 | 5.0 | 2016-09-15 00:44:28 | The moment you walk in to this restaurant you're going to notice the long french windows and ofcourse the most beautiful view which includes victoria memorial. The ambience is lovely, very warm and urban. We ordered Aam Pannas, Tiger beef, Prawn Ghee Roast, Pepper Calamari. All of them were to die for. For dessert we ordered Nolen gurer creme br√ªl√©e. Yumm yumm!! I would totally come again. Loved itüòä |
 
Monkey Bar | Sourav Mukherjee | 306717 | 4.5 | 2016-09-14 11:38:19 | Finally they have arrived in Kolkata after rocking Delhi , Mumbai , Bangalore etc. and a few of Corporate Monkeys could muster the courage and had enough stock of lame excuses (for residential purposes only) to visit this joint on the lazy Saturday afternoon last week. Very conveniently located at Camac Street , innovative food & drinks menu like Kerala Rice , Butterfly Chicken , Prawn Pil Pil and many more.¬† Personally I loved the ginger beer. It was a full house and it is nice to see that City of Joy has lapped up the Monkey Bar and the legendary versatile gastronomical journey of Kolkata has just added yet another feather . Must visit joint for foodies and a great place to unwind. Wishing luck and Highly recommended !!!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Siddhartha Chowdhary | 211170 | 4.0 | 2016-09-14 00:31:42 | Dim lights and chic interiors. A totally fresh take on gastropub culture. The place was almost full when we entered so 9 of us had to accommodate on a smaller table. They weren't serving alcohol today, and for the next few days also they are keeping the bar closed. we had to compromise on that and had to order the virgins. We had the much hyped 'maanga' which was nice and refreshing. Homemade ginger beer was good. Brownie cookie shake wasn't available. For starters we had chilli cheese dragons, cheese filled cigar rolls with spicy garlic sauce, the sauce was amazing. Rock Corn tempura was good, crisp and the teriyaki sauce was appropriately done. Loaded nachos was amazing. Potato with raclette which was fried potatoes topped with stringy mozzarella cheese, was basic and slightly spiced toped with pickled jalape√±os. We also ordered two types of pizza , roasted zucchini with parmesan and tomatoes and the other, mushrooms with truffle oil. I loved the mushroom one over the zucchini one. But the pizza looked a bit messy and wasn't also evenly crisp. Overall the service was spontaneous and amiable. I liked the overall experience though. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Chopra | 34103337 | 4.5 | 2016-09-13 20:44:04 | Monkey Bar is a grown up version of a slightly more casual neighborhood bar. With about 300+ gastro pubs in India it is only a matter of time when people start aping. The Calcutta version is setting it apart from the rest of the so called gastro pubs.

We had the good fortune of going to the private opening of Monkey Bar Kolkata on the 1st September, 2016. It was a small party for about a 100 people. The mood was up beat and there was a sense of relief and satisfaction on the staff who were hosting us. It has taken Monkey Bar Kolkata a little over 8 months to complete the restaurant.

The staff is from all across the country. This makes for some good interaction with them ‚Äì that is if you care to chat them up. The cocktails are more involved. There is reasonable work that is done to create the drinks behind the counter. Work as in ingredients have been mixed and labor have been put in to create a concoction or mixes. Not just opening bottles and squirting premixes in a shaker and serving things up. Almost like an artisan touch. The bases are fermented in house; you can see the large glass jars filled and sitting happy on the bar counter.

To begins with the view is something you must visit let alone anything else. Add the food and you have method to mayhem. The care that goes in the food here is evident when you have your first bites. With Chef Manu Chandra at the helm of the kitchen things are definitely going to have certain standards in terms of flavor and quality. There is always going to be a reason behind why what ever has been done to the food in the kitchen here at Monkey Bar.

Expect massive flavors and good service. In fact it is so good to see the city opening up to the kinds of Monkey Bar. This is a place where you can come in and kick back with friends on a weekend. This is one tree that we two monkeys are happy to call home. |
 
Monkey Bar | Jayeeta Basu | 360426 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 21:01:52 | So finally Kolkata gets Monkey Bar!! 
I have always loved the Bangalore  and the Mumbai Monkey Bar because of the ambience.  
First day, the space and the view is amazing!! They had a very limited drinks menu considering first day. I had Toast to Calcutta, Manga and Copper Grin. Toast to Calcutta was refreshing, adding smoke gondhoraj lebu,  it tasted even better.  Manga is something I have drank before.  Copper Grin was okay. 
Let's get into the food menu.  Prawn ghee roast,  Vada Pav,  Keema Pav the menu took me back to Bombay and South. 
I had the Korean sticky wings,  since I already came to Monkey Bar  after having dinner,  I sticked to one starter and drinks!
I am planning to head back to Monkey Bar pretty soon for full fledged meal and lot of Toast to Calcutta! 
Please stock the bar as it is extremely disappointing to come to Monkey Bar and sit with limited choices in terms of alcohol. |
 
Monkey Bar | Arushi Dhupia | 1597321 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 19:14:22 | Monkey Bar is on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building on camac. Visit in the evening and if you're sitting by the window panes, you can see the Victoria Memorial, lights twinkling from The 42, and the outline of a part of the Parama flyover. It's so cool! 
The music is good and the place has a very funky feel to it. The food is good, not excellent. 
Loved the pizza and the Med platter.  Corn kernels were okayish. 
The Loaded Nachos were Brilliant!! Lots of sour cream and Mexican beans and fully loaded as the name suggests! No other places in kolkata (apart from the Big Nachos at |
 
Monkey Bar | Shhashee Churiwala | 2053496 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 23:48:39 | The newest hub in kolkata with different design and fresco depicting old kolkata. The giant size windows showing the serene skyline of the city. Exhaustive menu with both indian and international cuisine with a twist. Prompt service , great tasting dishes both starters and mains accompanied humble pricing. A great place to kill your hunger. All in all good experience after a long time. A must visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Aihik Barua | 1850614 | 3.5 | 2016-09-11 22:10:16 | This review might change. This post is influenced mostly due to the nonavailability of alcohol , and I did see two or three bottles of liquor , anyway , about the interiors and location , bloody superb amazing selection , love it , would suggest it anybody , the bartenders ( coke tenders üòÇ) seemed cocky , but it's a relief to see a high end restaurant serving beef, that's fresh and the it was good actually , would go again for the booze ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Mansi Tulshan | 33240285 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 21:17:40 | Went there in the evening today to check out all the hype surrounding it. Guess what! Wasn't disappointed at all. We took a seat right next to the window(yes, I have a fascination for tables next to Windows) and was mesmerised by the breathtaking view of the city. The music, ambience were perfect for a chilled out evening with a great date(note:my husband).
The lemon iced tea was very good.. Perfect in taste. The staff recommended ' the med platter 'as a great vegetarian option and we decided to try that. The platter had falafel, pita pockets, cheese and spinach filos, and the usual dips. The hummus was great and we were serves a hearty portion if it which made us happy coz it's the dips which usually are heroes of this dish. The babagonoush was great and it had a smokey taste which was really good. The curd and cucumber dip definitely needs improvement. It was runny and tasted like buttermilk! Had no taste and we left most of it. The best part of the ambience was hookah had a separate enclosure and wasn't served inside the main restaurant! Will definitely return to this place for a relaxing evening! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sajid Feroz | 60540 | 1.0 | 2016-09-11 17:20:01 | New place and pathetic service....guy at the reception refused to give a table coz I was alone and suggested a table outside in open when it was so  hot outside.After a while I was a given a table with no seat n ws suggested to stand n eat (brilliant!) Although after some protest a seat was provided.i even noticed couples were asked to share a table even when some of the tables were empty ! It was quite bizzare !! imagine going on a double date with some strangers ! It was like they just wanted to give table to group of 4 or more ,again like I said restaurant was not even full!

Food was served ..I ordered a prawn dish ,peach ice tea and the snicker bar for dessert.prawn dish was good ,the ice tea wasn't served n after 45 minutes of ordering I was told it's not available .the snicker bar was good (recommended) !! Some how all the servers were lost in their own world ,roaming around in groups n hardly paying attention to customers ..that too when there was no rush at all ! 
 
I am not tat critical while writing reviews but m quite surprised how casual the staff was while handling their customers (that too being a new place in town).I have been to monkey bar in Delhi and tat place is amazing ! 

Service - 0/5
Decor -4/5 (lovely view of Victoria memorial n hoogly bridge ) 
Food - 3.5 (would love to explore more) 

Must have - the snicker bar |
 
Monkey Bar | Aadarsh Agarwal | 1183989 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 17:18:45 | The ambience and location of the place was top notch. With the bar not licensed yet the food surely compensated. There is a separate outdoor section for shisha takers. Lastly, the view of Victoria was the cherry on the cake. |
 
Monkey Bar | Reevu Wangdi | 284286 | 5.0 | 2016-09-11 00:42:46 | Great place to chill & dine... best thing is they serve beef...Tiger beef was succulent and spiced to perfection... Korean bulgogi beef rice was flavoursome ... chorizo pork pav was delicious... ampanna done right... and service was tops... gonna be back when the bar opens ..I believe next week it is... good going .. |
 
Monkey Bar | Devanshi Powani | 33090142 | 3.5 | 2016-09-10 23:54:27 | The snicker bar desert and the Aam aadmi eggs were the highlight of our dinner. Can't wait for the bar to start . Loved the service and the ambience. |
 
Monkey Bar | Jashita Ray | 589467 | 4.0 | 2016-09-09 19:52:29 | Had been waiting eagerly for the opening of Monkey Bar and there I was dragging my fiance, paying a visit in the first week itself. However I would say i rather got slightly disappointed. The staff seemed amateur. They were very amiable but highly confused. Firstly it took them over 20-25mins with repetitive reminders to serve us water. And further disappointment was on asking for the drinks menu, they informed us they didn't have license for alcohol. Thus we had to settle for mocktails. The person who took our mocktail order was so confused. He was unsure of the mocktails on offer, we had to specifically cue him with names like green apple or blue lagoon etc. And oh, there was no paper napkins, spoons and forks or sauces kept on the table for us as some had mentioned in previous reviews - we had to ask for them. Probably they don't have them kept in advance in the open air section.
Now the good part - Everything else!
The ambience - Wow. The view of the Victoria Memorial is simply stunning. You can just sit and spend hours adoring your surroundings.
We ordered a teen paan hookah, along with a Virgin Mangaa- Loved it and a Green Apple Soda which was decent, not that great. Next on our list were the Butterflies, Rooster Booster Burger & Chicken 65. The first two were mouthwatering, especially the burger - juicy, filling, yummilicious. And then the cherry on the pie - the dessert - Snicker bar- I genuinely recommend this. Loved the way they serve it and the taste is heavenly.
Overall, had a lovely evening with the MoBar Mojo! Just wished I could give it a 5 star rating. |
 
Monkey Bar | Luna Chatterjee (Madly_Food_Lover) | 1304639 | 4.5 | 2016-09-09 01:36:56 | The Monkey has finally swung east, and that too it's making it's presence felt !! After Mumbai and Delhi now Kolkata hasit own "Monkey Bar". 
To start with It's an amazing property that has a breathtaking view. You can just gaze at Kolkata skyline while sipping some amazing cocktails.
Curated by acclaimed chef Manu Chandra, Monkey Bar's menu boasts of innovative food and drinks. I absolutely loved each and everything that i tasted but some of the items and drinks need spl mention.
Kerala Rice Salad- A salad made with wild red rice, blended with herbs and topped with curd chilli, the dish is indigenous and light.
Med Platter-A dish which is a visual delight in itself apart from being a total amalgamation of fritters and dips.
Tikki of Joy- A perfect dish to satisfy the bong fish craving.
Butterfly Chicken- Chicken blended with herbs placed inside a butterfly shaped shell.
Prawn Pil Pil- Perfectly prepared Prawn served with bread. Simple yet delicious
Laal Maas Phulka Tacos-Rajasthani laal mash intelligently placed inside tacos, a perfect fusion food.
Spare Pork Ribs- This is ansolutely recommended for those pork lovers. The meat is tender and cooked to perfection in barbecue sauce.
The drinks served quenched our thirst perfectly, among them some needs spl mentionlike Manga, Copper Monkey, Pink Punch. 
The desserts are absolutely delightful.Gondhoraj Lemon Tart is sweet, with a bit of tang!! There is Snicker Bar whichbis total bliss.
So with the coming of Monkey Bar i can safely say that gastronomic revolution has indeed hit our City of Joy. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anamitraa/The Gut Filling | 671420 | 4.0 | 2016-09-09 00:46:21 | The City of Joy is witnessing a major change in the gastronomic culture post the technological revolution of smartphones and wireless technology. There has been evolution of the global food and Calcuttans are gradually getting used to it. After many multinational and national pubs coming to Kolkata, it was the turn for Monkey Bar to refresh Kolkata with its gracious presence.

This 3rd September, I was invited to the Pre Launch of the Kolkata Chapter where the #MonkeySwungEast. It was a lovely happy afternoon where all the foodies, bloggers, critics and experts had a gala time with beautiful cocktails, mocktails and great good.

The place is located at the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building in Camac Street. Blessed with a wonderful view, you can see the Victoria Memorial, St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral and Hooghly Bridge altogether. We had to pick up paper pieces with names of cocktails and sit at the assigned table to participate in games and quizzes. It was a lot of fun. Ambience is all classy with the bar and high chair along with couches. I loved the wall art on the gateway to the open air sitting area which is done with Gupi Bagha, Tana Rickshaw and all the nostalgic memoirs of Kolkata.

The food was equally good. There were many cocktails and I, being a teetotaler had the virgin versions of all the drinks. Some of them were great, actually. We had ‚Äì

Kerala Red Rice Salad - Baby spinach, red rice, raw mango, coconut, peanuts and upmensinkai (salted chilli from Karnataka). I generally do not eat chillies, but this one was so good. Loved it a lot.

Mac & Cheese Croquettes ‚Äì Golden fried broccoli and peas along with chilli mayo and salsa. I am a fan of cheese. So the croquettes were really admired.

Med Platter - Falafel, spinach, cheese filo parcels, hummus, smoked baba ganoush, roasted peppers, olives, with pita bread and labneh. The presentation of this platter was really an eye catching one. It was really good.

Smoked Beetroot and Beans Galouti - Melt in mouth vegetarian galouti on saffron laced taftan, onion and mint chutney. This dish too was okay.

Baked Brie ‚Äì Oh! I loved this dish. Brie cheese with filo surrounded by pineapple salsa. The cheese oozing out of the pastry created all the sensation. Loved this dish a lot. Had a huge share of it from my table.

Prawn Pil Pil - Tossed in olive oil with chilli, garlic and parsley. It was served with garlic rubbed toast. This was extremely delicious. Loved the dish a lot specially for its aroma and the garlic breads, specially.

Tikki of Joy - Kolkata inspired Bhetki fish cutlets with kasundi, fennel seed & coriander, served with mint chutney. This is one classic dish which no Calcuttan will ever fail to love. I was no exception.

Tiger Beef - Slices of steak tossed with chilli paste, black beans, galangal, ginger, bean sprouts, lemon, bok choy and peppers. This dish was a bit spicy, not suited to my taste but loved by my fellow foodies at the table.

Butterfly Chicken - Sweet, spicy, crispy bits of chicken tossed with sesame, chilli, honey and peppers; stuffed in our signature butterfly shells. The butterfly shells resembled to a savoury treat from the lands of Andhra Pradesh, popularly known as Phoolbu. This dish was unique, in presentation and taste.

Laal Maas Phulka Tacos ‚Äì Who doesn‚Äôt know about this classical delicacy of Rajasthan? Monkey Bar has successfully fused this Indian beauty along with Mexican Tacos. This twist in the cuisines creates the beauty of the culinary culture and here lies the skill of a chef, who is an artist in this case. Loved this dish for the innovation.

Spare Pork Ribs ‚Äì Trust me, it is the best pork dish I have had till date. The pork was so soft, juicy and tender that it literally melted inside the mouth. It was tossed in a tangy and sweet sauce which was really good. Writing the review after 5-6 days but I still can‚Äôt get over the beauty of the pork ribs.

Gondhoraj Lime Tart ‚Äì This was one unique dessert we have tried there. Lemon curd, torched meringue, lemon & mint gel, pistachio cake & cookie crust ‚Äì combination of all good things at one go. Loved the refreshing vibe of this dessert.

The Snicker Bar ‚Äì I am not a big Snicker fan. But this dessert along with the perfect swirls of the s‚Äômore has become one of the desserts to crave for at the strangest of times. Milk chocolate ganache, dark chocolate micro cake, hazelnut praline cream, salted caramel gel being the composition of this dessert, I loved it till the end.

Drinks ‚Äì Copper Monkey, Manga, Pack of Punch, Toast To Calcutta, Mad Men. I was in Team Copper Monkey. Had the virgin version of all the drinks. Liked the Manga to be the best, which they claim to be one of their signature cocktails along with Copper Monkey, which was also very good.

I would like to thank the nationally acclaimed figure Chef Manu Chandra to spend and share his valuable words about food and Team Monkey Bar for having us over and presenting a lifetime of memories. Best wishes to the team and may they prosper ahead. Happy Dining! :) |
 
Monkey Bar | The Hungry Desis (Ramya & Chiranjeev) | 30569103 | 4.5 | 2016-09-08 16:29:59 | Monkey Bar has finally come to the City of Joy and promises to be a perfect place to have fun and relax. When we walked into the gastropub, the first thing that came to our minds was "classy and quirky".¬†
The best of it all is the stunning view.  You have a clear sight of the St. Paul's Cathedral and the Victoria Memorial in the distance. The service staff are swift and attentive.
 Another thoughtful design is the assortment of condiments and cutlery set on the tables. You can use them as you like instead of calling for the servers everytime. The cocktails are innovative, using a variety of ingredients and the food is lip-smackingly delicious! Our recommendations are the Mangaa and the Tipsy Sherbet among the drinks. With regards to the food, the vegetarian dishes are as good as the non vegetarian ones. We suggest the Med Platter and the Baked Brie among the vegetarian choices. For the non-vegetarians, the Prawn Pil Pil is a must try. To achieve full satiisfaction, do sample the Snicker Bar..it is to die for! |
 
Monkey Bar | Varnika | 380228 | 4.5 | 2016-09-07 10:06:59 | The wait is finally over. The moment you enter Monkey Bar, you get the feel of the one in Bangalore. The open air area is simply amazing, the view of Victoria Memorial is breathtaking. 
I loved the ambience of the inner section as well. Even though it has some basic monkey bar elements missing the place is great overall. 
We ordered the MoBar Classic Chilli Cheese Dragons which were to die for. 
For drinks we had the Copper One which was quite bad. It didn't taste of Alcohol at all. 
Taste of Calcutta was refreshing and nice. Pack a punch was also decent. 
All in all once they start functioning full time and properly it will be a great place. Super excited! |
 
Monkey Bar | Roli Vajpeyi | 909801 | 5.0 | 2016-09-06 23:07:49 | Monkey bar finally opens in Kolkata! You guys are in for a treat the cocktails are so unique and nice you can't just order one! And the snacks are just awesome. This is my new hang out place. The desserts specially the snickers one is just amazing. |

Desi Lane | Poulami Prasad | 16328041 | 4.5 | 2016-12-05 09:58:22 | Just wow!! Yesterday night went 4 a bday party!! Grt ambience food was also good, satisfied service and a very nice place to hangout with friends.. The hookah was served with a bad coal though but they quickly replaced it and the chicken drumsticks was too spicy..  but the dance floor and the ambience was  attractive.. Thanks for a good time! ! |
 
Desi Lane | Vasuki Jasani | 34767270 | 5.0 | 2016-12-01 09:39:59 | We planned on having my parent's 25th wedding anniversary here and it was the best decision we made.
Ambience of this place just justifies its name and every bit of it has a desi touch. It gave a very cozy or rather comfortable feeling.
Drinks served to us were perfectly made and d starters were served absolutely hot.
This place has amazng props to click pictures with and the look of the entrance is gorgeous.....totally a picture taking zone!!!
Most importantly the food was delicious, the dal makhani, punjabi aloo and biryani is a must try here. |

Desi Lane | Mukesh D. Jasani | 36751864 | 5.0 | 2016-11-16 22:24:56 | Had thrown a private party of 40 guests on 12th November for my business associates in the Disc. Complete paisa wasool.....i got so many thank u messages from my friends saying that they never had such rocking party. Great party, great DJ, excellent service, the staffs were there till 2.30 am without a sign of frustration on their faces rather they were so very helpful. One of my friend was little high & puked. I wl never forget the service the manager gave to my friend. 
Thank u Desi Lane....I m really touched |
 
Desi Lane | Micky Gupta | 775896 | 5.0 | 2016-11-16 22:07:08 | Excellent place, great food, great vibes....a must must visit place. Highly recommended for private parties. Never experienced this kind of service anywhere. Desi Lane rocks !! |

Desi Lane | Eshita Surana Poddar | 2310310 | 1.0 | 2016-11-12 23:36:35 | Horrible experience # extremely bad service # order not served properly # undercooked food # on asking for cancellation, immediately excepted # paid deaf hear to problems |
 
Desi Lane | Arnab Datta | 32341647 | 5.0 | 2016-11-11 13:18:11 | If u are looking for a unique restaurant cum bar, then Desi Lane is the place to be... The ambience is simply something one has never experienced in Kolkata before. It is just like a local street with barber shops type themes, movie posters, khatiyas¬†(beds) as sitting places, etc etc... What's more is there's an Autorickshaw and a typical Bajaj scooter inside the place to excite all... The nostalgic movie posters from the golden era of Hindi ¬†cinema, the witty phrases all around will amuse you... It's like a walk down the memory lane of the old times before modernization of India.¬†

Additionally, there are games that one can play like the foosball, darts, spin a wheel, dice etc.

Wide choice of food and drinks with a variety of cocktails and mocktails will surely delight your taste buds. It's a fun place to be for sure and definitely a place one should visit with family and friends alike. Wouldn't like to spoil the fun by saying all that I found interesting there... So do visit this place if you get a chance...¬†One thing is for certain, if anyone visits Desi Lane, he or she is bound to return... for its one place you can never forget.

Keep up the good work Team Desi Lane!!! |

Desi Lane | Swati Bhartia | 31041168 | 2.5 | 2016-11-06 11:41:23 | Good ambience,nice decor,very spacious ,nice food but HORRIBLE service.....waiters hiding themselves when called , busy taking leftover hookah of customers n unability to serve....spoils every good thing about the place..  waiters are not at all trained n proffesional |
 
Desi Lane | Manan Sharma | 36618223 | 5.0 | 2016-11-05 21:13:28 | Superrr se upparrrr. .....super awesome food. Generally we see that restaurants & hotel ppl upload pictures which doesn't match with the actual place...pics r way better then the actual place bcos of photo editing effects but guys in your case it's just the opposite. ...u hv uploaded pics which r not that great whereas the actual place is far better...infact I have not seen such lovely concept & equally great food & service  at one place ...keep up the good work & keep raising the bar |
 
Desi Lane | Vmurarka77 | 1176524 | 3.0 | 2016-10-24 22:34:39 | The place has a mix theme of Bollywood & Village. It's very spacious. Has a couple of private dinning rooms for small parties & a disc. The food is good but nothing to rave about. |
 
Desi Lane | Tanshi Agarwal | 16343188 | 5.0 | 2016-10-21 13:36:07 | Superb Ambience! Delicious and sumptuous Food! Excellent service!!! Awesome music and very innovative props and interiors!! Loved it! Will definitely recommend to all my friends. |
 
Desi Lane | Sohini Sarkar | 33862921 | 3.5 | 2016-10-19 22:51:46 | Bring that color back in your dull looking life with colorful and tasty food in Desi Lane.

Welcoming you from the lanes of Alipore are multitudes of rainbow colored bulbs, old Bollywood posters and even a cute, yellow scooter.

Located on the posh street of Burdwan Road, Alipore, this place falls right after the SBI building.

Prettily decorated place, with spot clean tables, the restaurant cum lounge bar is divided into two settings. While the immediate entrance of the place leads you to their moderately large sized restaurant hall, the hookah lounge is located behind a cushioned closed door.

The lounge room has a large screen TV. They make their shisha good. Hitting the strong flavours are paan salsa, paan rasna while grape is noticeably a mild flavor. 

Their Chili Cheese Toast is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. This maybe a bit of extra enthusiasm for a piece of toast, but it deserves all of it. Crispy base with gooey cheese on top. And that is not all, the flavor is off the roof. A five out of five for this item.

Although this place deserves a five, there are somethings that disappointed me as a customer massively. The service here is bad.

I had ordered cheese sandwich for myself, but our waiter had misunderstood it to be toasts. The toasts as stated earlier were excellent. No complaints regarding that. However, the miscommunication led to a bill that was way too much.

Although it was later taken care of by the staff team, this sort of mistakes really does ruin a customer's experience on a huge scale.

The food here is excellent. So is the decor and the ambiance, hence the 3.5

I'll be coming back here because the food I believe deserves more than what I rated. One of your hidden gems in Alipore. Drop by and be amazed. |
 
Desi Lane | AkritiPoddar | 16125324 | 4.0 | 2016-10-17 14:04:28 | Amazingly themed and offers a great ambience. The quirky posters and the Desi khatiya were well thought of. Could be visited with both family and friends as the place hosts family crowds as well. The Service is very quick and they ensure all guests have a good time.
Do check out the Chinese dishes if you're looking for something spicy and crisp. 
Desi Lane surely lives up to it's name by creating the most suitable environment for Desi lovers. |
 
Desi Lane | Ajay Pandey | 36365984 | 5.0 | 2016-10-15 15:18:49 | One of the best place to be with your family and friends.

What an ambience, service & food. We have been used to ordering Dal Makhani whenever we go to a restaurant...but Desi Lane has made us addicted to their Dal Hariyali....lovely food...must try Fried Ice cream |
 
Desi Lane | Saloni Siotia | 36255423 | 4.5 | 2016-10-07 00:30:36 | The ambiance is really good. The food is also very good. Very happy with the wife variety on the menu.

Desi Lane | Surolia | 898402 | 5.0 | 2016-10-06 15:03:21 | Been to Desi Lane. Had vegetarian food over there without onion and garlic. I can say that no other restaurant can offer such delicious good without onion & garlic.
Hariyali Daal, Desi Videshi mixed veg and Fried Ice Cream are signature dishes which one can relish over there. |
 
Desi Lane | Ankita Patni | 3072545 | 4.5 | 2016-10-04 00:19:09 | One word for desi Lane ' WoW' . everything is so good about the place. Food, staffs , music , ambience , vibes . loved it to the core. Amazing ambience.  You feel so positive and happy here. Nice food. Must visit . |
 
Desi Lane | Swati Singhania | 1793405 | 5.0 | 2016-10-01 19:52:00 | I have been to this few times by now, and every time I step in the place..its always brimming with life. The food here is awesome.  I have tried their North indian food, Chinese and also few of the Italian dishes. All of them very relished by my taste buds.  But the best thing about the restaurant is that it has carved out a space for all. A separate section for family groups and parallely a separate section when you are dining with your friends. 
You can walk into the place and let the balance be taken care by their courteous team. Seems I have found another favorite joint! |
 
Desi Lane | Pritha Dasgupta | 36189124 | 5.0 | 2016-10-01 13:04:34 | full marks to u guys.great ambiance,great food,each and every ppl who worked here very much well-mannered,the hariyali dal was superbly tasty ...awesome blossom food ...keep it up! |
 
Desi Lane | Pamela Nandi | 2821382 | 4.0 | 2016-09-29 21:04:20 | Located on the first floor of the bldg The Enclave at the Alipore StateBank crossing - perfect adda placeto chill out with friends in desi style. Visited one sunday evening - the place is over crowded and noisy. But the highway like¬† theme with roadside low seaters and the bar - Desi Theeka will attract every guest to visit this place again and again. There are private dinning areas for family who would prefer to enjoy food away from the crowd and noise. Nothing new in the menu, but the food was good - butter lemon fish. In terms of service and hospitality, this eatery is a bit messy. Looks like they are still not yet well settled to serve the guests. |
 
Desi Lane | Sweta Agarwal | 36152816 | 5.0 | 2016-09-28 15:00:42 | A newly opened Resto bar in Alipore, the place is a must visit whether you planning a casual dine out with friends, family time over food, Night out with music and drinks or a private party for your group. The theme - totally desi with the right combination of quirkiness, adores the walls and indoors and the food - perfect for every taste and cuisine. Don't forget to get yourself clicked at the photo booth, on the scooter or inside the auto. Options galore, Desi Lane rocks.. |
 
Desi Lane | Dj ArV | 36141303 | 5.0 | 2016-09-28 00:36:40 | I went on a Sunday....it was chocobloc. We had to wait for around 30 odd minutes but it was worth the wait. Full marks to you guys....Great ambiance, great food.....thought service was little slow which is acceptable considering the kind of rush u had. Awesome awesome food ....keep it up !! |

Looks expensive but reasonable enough to plane for a date or a family dinner.
Thumps up for this place! !!!!!!!!!! |
 
Desi Lane | Gaurav Vyas | 31237453 | 5.0 | 2016-09-27 13:51:22 | We had the best Chinese food the other night at desi lane.

Desi Lane | Aakriti | 35147778 | 5.0 | 2016-09-19 14:12:06 | Awesome ambience and good food. This new restaurant houses a lounge, a separate hookah room , a karaoke room and the main floor. Quirky paintings and pictures adorn the walls with a great and colourful entry giving you the ultimate North Indian feel. They did a good job with the food as well. A must try |
 
Desi Lane | Deepshikha Saraf | 258224 | 2.5 | 2016-09-18 18:18:42 | The restaurant opened right next to my place. Had been planning to visit for a long while, ever since the soft launch. 
The ambience is okay. Desi lane doesn't match with the feel. The old posters is the only design feel. The chairs are so high! Almost like a bar. And the sofa are so low. The distance between the table and the sofa is so much that u have to shift aage and bend over to eat!!! 

The food is a major let down. We were two of us. So we order cheese kurkure kebab as starters- it was  bland. The roti covering was to thick. And the filling was bland. All u could taste was cheese. No seasoning, nothing. 

Then we ordered for a hariyali sabji moti and a lachcha paratha. The sabji was horrible 
üôàüôàüôà semi raw veggies, bland taste. 

The roti though was crisp and thin. |
 
Desi Lane | Avantika Agarwal | 35835337 | 4.5 | 2016-09-16 11:32:11 | Desi Lane offers an ultimate desi experience, With delicious food and desi decor, it is definitely worth a try. To add to it, It has a very convenient location.¬†

This desi restaurant is every foodie's delight and it offers a large variety of cuisines. ¬†The ambience is very desi and different¬†with khatiyas and autos. We ordered crackling spinach, spaghetti¬†nepolitan,¬† risotto and pizza which tasted very good. We also ordered hookah which was very smooth. ¬†

The staff was very friendly. I strongly recommend this place. |
 
Desi Lane | Ankita Sharma | 35907184 | 5.0 | 2016-09-16 11:26:02 | It is one of my favourites in Kolkata.

Desi Lane | Amit Ruia | 27608956 | 1.0 | 2016-09-15 13:40:33 | Went there this saturday 10/09/16 the service was poor, we ordered two starters in which one was partly left uncooked still they did not give much heed to it as they waiters were more busy with party in inside hall hence we paid the bill and went to red lounge third floor |
 
Desi Lane | Neel Kankani | 35968237 | 4.5 | 2016-09-13 21:20:56 | Excellent food and wonderful ambience . Nice service . Food quality and quantity both are good . Tried plenty of starters and all the items were good |
 
Desi Lane | Kanishk Toshniwal | 1125210 | 5.0 | 2016-09-13 13:01:14 | Yet another amazingly themed restaurant.. The Desi Lane . Themed with the desi lanes of India . The Bollywood posters .. The truck paintings .. The khatiyas. Raju communications.. It was a different experience for me . The food is good . The quantity is also very good the service was also very quick . The Sultani paneer tikka was superb .. Give a try to the dal makhni.

Desi Lane | Sneha Bhowmick | 35906810 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 17:26:54 | Newly opened with outstanding ambience and DJ on the dance floor. The food was also really great. The main sitting area houses some cool ‚ÄòCharpai‚Äô, as one may see on the roadside Dhabas. The Charpai section has been divided into separate halves, with each of these halves, displaying a unique theme of its own.¬† However it's worth a visit. |
 
Desi Lane | Sumita Chatterjee | 35949403 | 5.0 | 2016-09-12 13:33:34 | Mind blowing ambiance, huge huge place...not seen such big a place in kolkata atleast. Courteous staff , great food, equally good hookah. Keep it up guys...didn't  expect such excellent food & service ...pricing also quiet decent. Only one suggestion...increase the food portion of the veg platter. |
 
Desi Lane | Hari Sharma | 35949145 | 5.0 | 2016-09-12 13:06:42 | Went on a Sunday. It was chocobloc. Still preferred to wait for almost 35 - 40 mins. Have no idea how almost 40 minutes passed. I Was just looking at the amazing interiors & my wife & son were busy taking selfies. So courteous staffs that even after being over occupied due to heavy rush they served us water & offered a fresh lime to my son free of cost...100 rupee worth of free fresh lime is not a big deal but its difficult to see this kind of a personal touch & respect for guests ...most restaurants don't even allow to stand in the restaurant area when they are full.  Food quality was equaly good & worth the wait. As far as the food quality is concerned would rate it amont the top 3 in kolkata. Will recommend a must must visit for this place. Completely in love with this place. |
 
Desi Lane | Rajni Agarwal Gupta | 31655966 | 1.0 | 2016-09-12 00:23:03 | One of d worst place i have visited in recent times, pathetic service,pathetic people....i visited on a Sunday and i knw d fact tht i might hv to wait, but hete no one is thr to guide u as to whn can u get a table,after repeated attempts they did give us a table without cleaning and we had to repeatedly ask them to clean up after which they obliged....no water giving nothing fr which again we had to ask n thn icing on d cake was water falling frm AC vent on d table ws r seated n whn d waiter said to d manager he was so damn cool abt it n his reply was tht " haan pata hai pani girta hai,ruko change kar denge table" ...this was enough test of our patience n we decided to leave thn n thr without hvng nythng n ths was d kind of service they r providing after 10.30 p.m.which is not tht peak timing.Sorry bt i wud request d readers to just think twice bfore visiting d place coz at d end its nt only bt d ambience,its all avout service u provide to d customers. |
 
Desi Lane | Megha | 1936800 | 1.0 | 2016-09-11 20:12:58 | Placed an order for a chicken steak and a chicken tikka masala kabab for home delivery. After 20 mins of placing the order I got a call from them saying that the steak was not available. I went ahead with the kabab order. 
The kabab was absolutely chewy and unedible!! The mint chutney served with it was watery. I don't think that I would want to order again. Paid 450 bucks for this. What a waste of money!!! |
 
Desi Lane | Harsh Borar | 309524 | 4.0 | 2016-09-07 17:32:05 | Great Food. Great Location. Massive space. They have separate dining sections for groups, a decent sized lounge.
The only problem I found was the noise coming from the lounge everytime the door opens , that's too loud for the people sitting inside. |
 
Desi Lane | Nikunj Agarwal | 309164 | 5.0 | 2016-09-04 00:08:49 | We were a group of 20 and we took a private area of the venue. Each and every guest in our group enjoyed the venue, the ambience, the fact that we were in a private area which felt like a private home longe where we could unwind the way we want. The food was awesome, the energy of the team of Desi lane was such that they were eager to give us a great experience. Loved every moment. Thank you desi lane for making our evening memorable. |
 
Desi Lane | Hamzaa Mohammed | 27460420 | 4.0 | 2016-09-02 15:37:14 | Love the food here. Totally worth it. Desi lane is very different from other North Indian joints in the city. For its amazing hookah and quirky interiors, it's definitely worth a visit. |
 
Desi Lane | Manisha Sharma | 35396500 | 5.0 | 2016-08-26 09:53:59 | I hv visited this place last night with my family. Amazing food , specially Indian cuisine and great hospitality. Ambiance is superb, every corner is different, entertainment full on .Best place to go. |
 
Desi Lane | Yamini Kedia Jhunjhunwala | 2455586 | 2.0 | 2016-08-25 17:43:19 | Horrible food . Just one word .. Horrible .. Good ambience .. Hooka was choking . Kali Dal was so sweet . Veg manchurian was over fried and smelly . It has nothing to do with discount as it hardly matters . |
 
Desi Lane | Juhi Ramakant | 34669926 | 1.0 | 2016-08-20 17:26:51 | First of all its got no signage at ground level making it tough to locate
when you reach the first floor, it looks like under construction because of the outside
seating is not really comfortable and the place is too too bright that it hurts the eye
the food is below average and there is a massive room for improvment
the service is quick which is the only thing i liked about the place |
 
Desi Lane | Sudipta Majumdar | 843646 | 4.5 | 2016-08-19 22:08:23 | Curious me dropped in Desi Lane on the very first week of its opening and I was clearly bowled out by the vibrant ambience.Located in plush Alipore, this themed den can be best described as a place that encourages one to unwind with good friends. This week I returned to celebrate my birthday with a whole bunch of pals, and my guests had a rolling time. The in-house Dj sure knows how to keep you on the dance floor. The selfie wall is to die for, and the food was just the perfect accompaniment. Having our slurp of tom kha gai or the lip-smacking Desi Lane special meatballs would be remembered for long. A space buzzing with desi vibes, the place surely created a whole new experience for us friends.  Thank you Desi Lane for making my birthday celebration an affair to cherish. |
 
Desi Lane | Sbalaji82 | 15744691 | 5.0 | 2016-08-07 18:17:06 | On a recent trip to Kolkata, a friend of mine took us along to this new restaurant "DESI LANE"..initially i was skeptical to have a get together in a untested restaurant..but the moment it stepped in my thoughts changed and i got carried away into the ambiance..Food was fantastic and economical..the staff were also very cooperative..music too was good..end to end a good place to enjoy and let yourself loose..seems like the place is calling me back with Sir Rabindranath Tagores famous patriotic song "Jodi Tor Dak Shune Keu Na Ase Tobe Ekla Cholo Re....... (calling me to comeback even alone to this place...)" ..Thanks for bringing this in such a beautiful city |

Desi Lane | Subhrajit Pramanick | 35464832 | 4.5 | 2016-08-01 23:51:56 | This place was in my mind to for quite some time and finally when I decided to visit it was one good decision. The ambiance is superb and the place is amazing in so many ways. This place really took me on a nostalgic trip with its interiors. Food and Drinks: Well, this part was really amazing. Starters were a lovely affair. I started off with
with ‚ÄúShajani Murgh Bahar‚Äù and my veggie friend‚Äôs favorite ‚ÄúGolden Baby corn with Spinach Sauce‚Äù both was delicious! 
The main course was the next best thing to arrive on our table. 
Mutton Rara Ghost .. you should not miss this one , its best in the town . Mutton is soft to the core with one Kabli Naan . On the other hand my friend was moved with ‚Äú Benarashi Dum alu and ‚Äú Lacheder paratha..

Coming to the desserts, we ordered ‚ÄúMalpuya with Rabri . never tried this combination but definitely would have missed if not tried .

Service:The service here is superb. The staff is courteous and is always on their toes to assist you with everything. They serve with smile and I am definitely coming back here :) |

Monkey Bar | 18361667 | (22.544307, 88.352079) | https://www.zomato.com/kolkata/monkey-bar-camac-street-area | ['American', 'Asian', 'European', 'North Indian'] | 


Monkey Bar | Sirsha Dhar | 2015246 | 4.5 | 2016-12-15 21:54:11 | My friend, who was leaving the city soon wanted to go out for food and drinks and what could have been better than our decision to hit the Monkey Bar. Finally opened in Kolkata, one of the best-located bar there possibly is. On the 9th floor of Fort Knox on Camac Street, this looks down the beautiful Kolkata skyline with the 2nd bridge, Victoria, St. Pauls church and what not. The place is huge, quaintly decorated with the essential Bong touch both in the menu and the bar. Has an open area with a huge screen. 
For food we ordered the Mobar Caramelised Pork Ribs. Melt in the mouth pork meat. Smoked Chicken, Chicken Salami and Harissa pizza. For drinks we took the Beamer LIIT. Just the right punch of alcohol and tang! Lovely experience. Would definitely like to go back again. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohan Belani | 3081061 | 3.5 | 2016-12-15 02:58:39 | The place has a chill vibe . Went with a few school buddies.  There is a open air section as well as an indoor section where you can sit and chill . Drinks were nice . Service could be better . The staff were not attentive enough . Lastly the music . There were people singing karaoke. I mean it's cool to sing and all but we expected some chill music with the setting . |
 
Monkey Bar | Pratik Shah | 31614924 | 3.0 | 2016-12-14 13:50:20 | With an indoor and outdoor seating options and great ambience "monkey bar" is sure to impress you . I didnt order much to eat , bt watever i ordered was average - 
Yes it is lil on the expensive side - overall good place to chill once in a while . |
 
Monkey Bar | Shruti Bhaiya | 593379 | 4.0 | 2016-12-11 17:47:13 | A must go places for the party peeps in kolkata.  Good food , good music and an awesome ambience. .  A complete thumbs up .. the only thumbs down would be the quantity  of the food served , it's too little and gives u just a taste of the dish !! |
 
Monkey Bar | Avinaba Das Sarkar | 409341 | 3.0 | 2016-12-11 11:02:59 | Went yesterday with a business partner, wasn't really very particular about a place but since it was located near by thought of visiting it once. Few observations

1. The ambiance is nice and the interiors are pretty well done.

2. Music is pretty loud and if you are intending to have a prolonged conversation with someone it would be difficult. 

3. The biggest drawback is the food, we ordered two veg starters since my friend was veg. The quantity and the taste wasn't something justifying the price or the brand. The food was OK but it isn't something one will find difficult to prepare in there kitchen. 

Overall experience was okay since we primarily went there to seat and talk. But comparing the same with the likes to cafe mezzuna or the grid would make this place average at the best. Hope the management looks into it. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rishi Agarwal | 1632482 | 4.5 | 2016-12-10 17:02:43 | On the 9th floor at Fort Knox, the newly opened Monkey Bar is a beautiful place to visit. The place offers an unmatched view of the city and the interiors and a class apart which make it one step ahead of other places in the city.
The food on offer is delicious. The mushrooms I ordered and the chilli cheese dragons are a must try for all.
Overall a great new place to visit with a great atmosphere and very polite attendants. |
 
Monkey Bar | TraveKings | 29893242 | 4.5 | 2016-12-07 13:14:55 | Located at Fort Knox. It is like Social in Delhi. Good Ambience. Maintaining a Good Standard. Decent Crowd. Decent Hookah & Decent Food. Good Service.¬†2 big screen to enjoy live sports .¬†Little expensive. It will cost around Rs.3000 for 2 person.A Good place to hangout with friends. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sukanya Ghosh | 589490 | 3.5 | 2016-12-04 21:24:11 | This one is new in Kolkata, and is definitely pulling lot of crowd. I went there on a Friday evening with two of my friends and it was full of people. Located in camac street, near Urban Desi, not too difficult to locate. The moment you step in , the first thing you notice are the big french windows with a view to die for :), Howrah Bridge and Victoria Memorial at the same, who would not love that!¬†
Now coming to the food, its nothing extraordinary, very mediocre tasting with prices on the higher side. We ordered for 1 mix mushroom bruschetta, mushroom and truffle oil pizza, and tikki of joy (fish). The bruschetta and the pizza was very ordinary, bland in taste I would say. Tikki of joy was definitely good with very subtle flavours, perfectly cooked to perfection.
My rating is truly for the ambience and the fish, anyway one could always try out this place¬†
Thumbs up for the view :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Gunjan Saraf | 33964908 | 4.5 | 2016-12-03 14:49:16 | My visit to this place raised my bar of expectations from kolkatas nightlife.. Posh crowd, sophisticated ambience, soothing music, projector screen for matches, good food and superb hukka! The place has it all. We ordered for lebanese platter and cheese spring rolls, both finger licking good! The capuccino cofee was average but the hukka made up for it! A must visit for all the crazy kolkatans looking for a break from chai break! |
 
Monkey Bar | Subham Agarwal | 777244 | 1.0 | 2016-12-01 13:05:10 | THIS PLACE IS PATHETIC

I ATE THE PANEER KHICHDI AND I AND MY FRIEND BOTH ¬†HAD A TERRIBLE INFECTION AFTER HAVING THIS. I THINK THEIR COOKING STANDARDS ARE VERY LOW.

WHEN I CALLED THEM TO SAY THAT I HAD A TERRIBLE INFECTION AFTER HAVING YOUR FOOD THEY ¬†HAD NO ANSWER.

I HAVE ALSO PUT UP A COMPLAIN AT FOOD AND QUALITY STANDARDS DEPARTMENT AGAINST THEM,

I SUGGEST NO ONE SHOULD GO THERE AT ALL. |
 
Monkey Bar | Risshe Malhotra | 31063007 | 4.5 | 2016-11-29 22:39:12 | Amazing food lovely ambience, joy is one of the best ppl he makes you feel special and the service is out of the world. Centrally located... |
 
Monkey Bar | Reetuparna Dutta | 1190721 | 4.5 | 2016-11-28 17:24:05 | Great place good food and good atmosphere. Loved the drinks as well ordered the manga with absolut and hot wings and loaded nachos with chicken . Everything was top notch. |
 
Monkey Bar | Kirti Agarwal | 16014301 | 3.0 | 2016-11-28 15:30:12 | I think it is one of the over rated places..the service was ok..music was very sad n sheesha not dat great...although ambience was good..but such a brand it is..der is an expectation bar which it disappoints to a great extent. |
 
Monkey Bar | Amrita Ghosh | 33949647 | 4.0 | 2016-11-26 20:51:37 | Want to dine with a view of Victoria memorial, step in here, which interiors n amazing food, gud classics as music and a lovely crowd, one cn spend hours here dining n wining. Food: chicken nachos is a good quantity. Mediterranean platter a lovly combo of flavors n great taste. Pizzas are thin crust n perfect. Drinks are innovative, I tried mamas girl & mojitos. Its one a litl higher side on the pocket but not exorbitant. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sanjiv Sood | 186102 | 4.5 | 2016-11-26 07:39:01 | The ‚ÄòMonkey Bar‚Äô Kolkata Avatar is a welcome addition to it's watering hole map and what an experience it metes out! Located in the heart of the city (Camac Street) with a huge and lofty space, it exudes a comfort zone feel. The visual delight of the interior space couples well with a spectacular view of the Kolkata skyline from the restaurant.¬†

The cream de la cr√®me among the restaurant‚Äôs USP's is the outdoor seating arrangement of about 5-6 tables. Although open to air, yet it is air-conditioned to beat the muggier months. Incidentally during the clement months it would be a pronounced experience to soak in Kolkata‚Äôs mild winters. The corner verandah serves hookah for the y-generation and for those who love to smoke with their tipple it is a rather comfortable space. I loved the incipient November chill all through the evening in the outdoor! It would be an idyllic place all through the wintery months to soak in the chilled weather.

Though I am not a cocktail loving person, I ventured out to try some of their swinging concoctions. First shot was the famed Manga.

Sweet and Tangy Vodka based cocktail, it had an all desi flavour burst from the Aam Panna as the main base with its signature cumin flavour to follow. It comes in a kullar shaped glass with etched in a typical Hinglish font that sets the tone for a fusion evening. 
Next, was the more stylized ‚ÄòMad Men‚Äô a Bourbon base with Coffee Orange and a whiff of Rosemary spray, which, I really liked and got myself a double dose.

 
 

Getting headier, I tried out the Copper Monkey, lo and behold but predictably it was in a copper mug. I quite liked the passion fruit flavour and the hint of mint in it worked well.

¬†

Although christened as ‚ÄòMonkey Bar‚Äô one would be rather surprised to see a super array of fusion food alongwith some very innovative desi leaning twisters. One look at the menu and I was instantly attracted to the Laal Maas Phulka Tacos, Radish cake bites for its novelty, Mobar Caramelized Pork ribs for its slow cooking and the Butterfly Chicken for the signature shells. 
The Laal Maas in the Phulka Tacos was juicy and well done, served on a ¬†Bao Stand for appeal as well as to function as a 'hold on'.  The meat was unique in flavour and spiced up enough to support its Laal Maas Status! 

 

The radish /mooli cake bites were indeed a experience though one really cannot make out if radish is used as the main filling ingredient unless told. The Tempura batter and the black bean sauce make up for the frunchy bite and flavour of the Radish bites.

 

The caramelized rib was succulent and smokey, living up the 6-hour slow cooked traditional method. So was it's house sauce quite zesty and lip smacking. 

 

The Butterfly Chicken was perhaps the only dish, which I would give the pass, though a visual delight again. I was lead to believe or was expecting a Butter Chicken filling. Maybe that is a good idea too.

Overall this place is not all just ambience, though that feeling is certainly overwhelming and sets up the mood. The service, food and the liquid chemistry in the cocktails are commendable too.

Monkey Bar | Kaustav Nayak | 1276373 | 5.0 | 2016-11-25 09:43:48 | With its French windows giving a glimpse of both the Victoria Memorial as well as the Howrah Bridge, the ambient lighting, great music, brick walls, a gorgeous skylight, a section that projects black and white motion picture and an apparently messy but ultimately symmetric seating arrangement that will please the OCD in you, Monkey Bar is hands down the best looking place in town. The ambiance, crowd and the location itself (9th floor of the Fort Knox building in Camac Street) itself demands a high rating. But it outdoes itself in the food department as well.¬†

The tiger beef is an instant classic. Perfectly cooked and just the right amount oily, this is a dish that I will highly recommend. The chettinad chicken samosas on the other hand flattered to deceive, definitely not worth the high price. Reddy's chicken popcorn though is a whole different story : small pieces of chicken fried with curry leaves, ¬†sesame, coconut shreds and a concoction of south Indian spices.¬†The name that will pique your interest however is the butter chicken khichudi. Bengali style sticky rice cooked amalgamated with Punjabi style chicken butter masala, this is a dish that has sharp flavors very well attuned for the Indian tongue. I absolutely loved it! 4 small cups containing curd, ghee, pickle and papad are given as accompaniments.¬†
¬†

And just everything else, their dessert section is more than competent too. While the snicker bar with its milk chocolate ganache on a crunchy almond base and a chocolate cake below may feel a tad too sweet, they provide a coffee ice cream to go with it and together the balance is delectable. The gondhoraj lime tart was more in my wheelhouse : the tangy lime curd really stood out. If I have to recommend one among these two I'd say take a leap of faith, ditch the always reliable chocolate and go for the tart.¬†

Here's to next time. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pratik Sensarma | 10848301 | 5.0 | 2016-11-22 20:50:17 | A too good place to b with your friends...had been there some days before...services are good...and ambience... Wat a place... After a long time had been to such an awesome place like this... One could have a marvelous view of the city Kolkata... Specially our Victoria memorial and cathedral Church...the foods are very tasty ...starting from Manga , tiger beef, tikki of joye to other cocktails  everything was perfectly made and served. Then lastly the desserts...the chocolate cake mainly... Was the best... Really had an too good time..keep it up guys  :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Anusreea Paul | 2257306 | 4.5 | 2016-11-21 12:13:39 | The famous brand is finally here in Kolkata. It's been three months since they opened doors on Camac Street and there's been no looking back for them :)
Had the opportunity to visit the place thanks to a bloggers meet. This is the brain child of chef Manu Chandra, the team, the food is crafted by him. The place epitomizes awesomeness in every inch. The place is big, read huge!! The huge old school windows lead you to stare at the city landscape with wide open eyes. They have an open seating arena, high rise chairs and comfortable sofas to choose from. They serve alcohol and hookah. They even arrange for sundowners on wintry afternoons, for you to sip on their lavish cocktails and enjoy the sun going down. The Victoria Memorial and the Howrah bridge are visual delights. They have their pub rules hence it is better to read them up and visit!
The crafted menu for the afternoon:

**Drinks**

Copper Monkey: Served in a copper vessel with a ¬†chunk of orange came this cocktail, whiskey based.

Manga: The ever famous drink, vodka based, a concoct of vodka and mango pulp.

Hipster Smash: Smacking name, and a refreshing drink! The array of colors are incredible. Mix of watermelon juice, a huge chunk of frozen watermelon and vodka.

Old Fashioned on Camac: The name might sound synonymous with rum but it is a whiskey based cocktail.

**Food**

Kerala Red Rice: A vegetarian and a non-vegetarians' delight! Thick red rice mixed with southern spices. It's spicy, it's crunchy, and it's tangy!!

Tiger Beef: The best, best, best beef is served here!! A bowlful of spicy meaty delight!! The shredded, well cooked, perfectly spiced beef served as the best chakna with the cocktails. Quite filling, good in quantity. Must order and highly recommended.

Butterfly Chicken: The outer coatings are designed like butterflies. Fried to perfection, oil less, the butterfly winged shaped cups are visual delights. Filled inside the cups are shredded chicken mixed in a nice sauce. Recommended for the sheer taste, intensity of the dish, and the efforts behind the perfect butterfly wings!

Shammi Sliders: These little burgers are lovely to look at. They do not fill you up completely yet leave you quite satisfied. The minced meat patties are perfect and there's no saucy drips. You actually do not mess yourself up eating this. Accompanied with some house special fries served inside a cute monkey bar wrapper.

Tikki of Joy: Quite a big hit down south, they decided to include it in their Kolkata menu as well. Huge chunks of bhetki frie to perfection. Served with onion rings and mint chutney. Crispy, ample fish in every mouthful, not oily at all.

Lal Maas Phulka Tacos: even sized parathas half rolled like rolls, filled with minced juicy meat. The meat is tender and you would feel like you are eating a roll, Kolkata style!!

**Desserts**

Gondhoraj Lime Tart: Tad a bit too bitter if eaten without the entire chunk. The idea is take a bit of the biscuit base, the creme, the lemon curd, the pistachio cake, and the raspberry sugared petals. And you could keep eating that and stare into the dreamy wintry sky line. But make sure to get a window seat..:)

Old Monkey Signature Chocolate Cake: What is a chocolate if it does not make you high!!! Well, this one sure does...a huge chunk of chocolate bar sprinkled with praline and caramel sauce. Served with a little scoop of ice cream...aaahhh never felt better!!¬†

Guys, agar aap Monkey Bar nahi gaye to please jaldi jaiye...it's waiting for you!! The coolest place in town to rock and roll. Try their karaoke nights or their usual dining hours, you will not be disappointing!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Suruchi Bhawsinghka | 1140387 | 3.0 | 2016-11-21 09:59:22 | The amount of tax,service charge vat, and wat not they are adding is insane.I have been to so many resto ,trust me this place is not worth it.I would rather sit in a five-star hotel lounge to spend around 5k between 4 ppl. If you leave aside the taxes you would always want to visit this place .Loved d simple decor(specially the huge windows ) perfect place to chill with friends and enjoy your drink.Snacks are average .Guys pls check ur taxes ...u r being unreasonable !!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Prarthana Roy | 1683183 | 3.5 | 2016-11-20 21:42:56 | Firstly , very much overpriced ! But fell in love with their decor and view .. food is overpriced according to their portion and most importantly they don't taste sound to be priced that much ! And coming to tax .. 1000 bucks ?! U will surely be left with a whole in ur pocket .. recommended for once , strictly ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Silpa Chattopadhyay | 34373588 | 5.0 | 2016-11-14 18:17:33 | Luv d this place....gud ambi ...v gud music...nice food.....n quiet disiplined as well i must say....everyone gets a place to sit n r attended well by the staff...i hv been to a no.

Monkey Bar | Dhawal Pratap SIngh | 442772 | 3.5 | 2016-11-14 14:34:01 | The place has excellent ambience and definitely scores well on the food quality. However, the portions are really small adding on to the already heavy cost. Instead of 1500 for 2, its a place where you will incur Rs1500 per person. Plus the taxes are a lot on the pocket. Our regular bill of Rs 4800 had Rs2000 worth of taxes amounting to a total of Rs 6800! Paying 40% tax on top of my bill is not something I was looking forward to. |
 
Monkey Bar | Supriya Baid | 34842096 | 5.0 | 2016-11-13 20:55:15 | One of the best ambience i have ever seem in kolkata! Fabulous üëå great crowd. Good servers. Well maintained. Lovely presentation of food. Hookah love üíï keep it up guys ‚úå |
 
Monkey Bar | Shruti Keshri | 12428511 | 1.0 | 2016-11-08 22:26:50 | Pathetic place, the food quantity is so less, waiters don't understand anything, once you order the order only comes when you die hungry. We waited for  bill for almost 14 mins and then left, the waiter came running out to get the bill, and top of that the bill was wrong, they charged us for we didn't order also.

Over priced, lazy, pathetic place. Never visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | The Calcutta Foodie | 36569739 | 4.5 | 2016-11-08 11:14:50 | Monkey bar is the newest attraction in town and rightly so, talking about interiors the biggest hit is the huge Windows showing the skyline of Calcutta, it's a breathtaking view from the 9th floor. 

The menu is quite innovative and the concoctions in terms of the cocktails are pretty darn good.

The food doesn't disappoint at all the butterfly chicken was crispy and juicy which is very rare a combination and the pork ribs had a smokey barbecue flavour to them and were very, very soft. 

The place is slightly expensive, but, with that ambience and quality, it's hardly an issue. |
 
Monkey Bar | Ms_WalkingShoes | 1193155 | 4.5 | 2016-11-07 18:24:29 | Read d reviews on Zomato n planned to pop over to dis place.
The interiors..ambience...music..crowd n d staff is absolutely perfect.
The view is jus mindblowing n d breeze is so soothing.
We ordered Prawn Pil Pil which was yum..
The Beef Pickle and the Pork Sausages were a bit disappointing.
We had two beers and a virgin mojito.
D thing dat was bit disappointing was dat our bill was 2368Rs...out of which 535Rs was jus all kinda tax.
Overall this place is one of d best plc to hangout around. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rishav Dey | 193398 | 4.0 | 2016-11-07 14:01:53 | Six of us landed up at Monkey Bar on a Saturday evening. It was a nightlife hotspot at 19:30 hours already and we had to wait almost 40 minutes before we could be seated. We were ushered in and given the offer of crowding around the bar which we accepted.
The ambiance was great. Music was good and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Making a conversation wasn't the easiest thing to do but at places like this that is quite expected. 
We kicked off the evening with a portion of Loaded Nachos, 4 helpings of Pack a Punch, one Old Fashioned on Camac with bourbon and one Mama's Girl with Absolut. The last two we had to settle for because Toast to Calcutta couldn't me made due to lack of availability of gin. The nachos were appetizing and I liked my old fashioned with bourbon but the accompanying almond biscotti was too sweet for me. The pack a punch was good but the Mama's Girl was not appreciated by any one.
The Aam Admi Eggs went down well with me. It reminded me of the bhel puri walas and their chutneys. The eggs were soft but firm. It made me crave a bit for the soft, gooey and runny yolk. The Hispter Smash was nice but the Tipsy Sherbet was quite interesting for me because I have always wondered how alcohol would blend with rose syrup and Mo Bar did a wonderful job. The Copper Monkey was a bit like a fruity mint julep but I did like it. The Not so Vanilla was not quite my kind of cocktail with the creamy texture so I exchanged that for the Hipster Smash with a friend. The best cocktail according to me was by far the Mad Men. All the flavours combined really well and complimented each other beautifully. Coffee and orange always work well but the subtle rosemary was a delightful addition. 
The duck pita pockets were great. Oriental flavours in between a pita was an unusual combination but the pita seemed to go quite well with the duck in five spice and the hoisin sauce. The Kerala Beef Fry was nice but I would have loved to have it with Malabar parotta instead of the bread they served. The smoked chicken pizza was decent too. 
The service was very good. There was a period in between when we were very unhappy with the excruciatingly slow service but our server was extremely apologetic about it and cited the reason of a busy weekend evening for the barmen. It was understandable as far as I was concerned. The value for money is perhaps a bit on the lower side and I would say Mo Bar is a moderately expensive place. The food was mostly good. The drinks too were mostly very good. And I couldn't get enough of the Mad Men. So I will return for the Mad Men and to try the beef bulgogi, tiger beef, Goan chrizo pav, baked brie and prawn ghee roast. Recommended if one doesn't mind spending a bit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sharan Bansal | 394157 | 5.0 | 2016-11-06 18:14:14 | Amazing new York style ambience in Kolkata. Great hospitality and service! We had an awesome Sunday lunch with friends over champagne , rum punch and beer ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sahil Islam | 1001945 | 5.0 | 2016-11-05 00:53:16 | Lovely place with nice decor ...... The pricing was excellent given the quality of the food even for non drinkers it is a not to be missed spot loved the duck pita pocket and snicker bar |
 
Monkey Bar | Harsh Agarwal | 615445 | 4.5 | 2016-11-03 22:40:49 | Food, decor and ambience is top notch. Kolkata has got a Gem restaurant and bar. The view and seating is made for each other.

For the egg lovers-"Aam aadmi eggs. Sheer brilliant dish. Must try if you visit.

The staff needs to be a little polite and polished. Lack hospitality and softness. If they can improve upon this, it will be no doubt the finest joint in the city.

Will surely visit again. |
 
Monkey Bar | Santanu Adhikary | 31601287 | 4.5 | 2016-11-02 15:01:09 | Awesome ambience. ..mesmerising view of our beloved quintessential kolkata. ..love the taste of butterfly chicken and nachos with whisky. .. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul | 20537314 | 4.0 | 2016-10-31 13:45:15 | Great food, smooth shisha and pleasant staff at a great location. The food served was fresh and tasty. Though the open area for shisha is a little congested. This is a perfect alternative to bar exchange since the staff is very pleasant. Had an outing with 8 of team mates on October 25, costed 7.5 k excluding alcohol. Will be my preferred location for after work outings as long as the staff is pleasant. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pooja Marwaha | 1981882 | 4.0 | 2016-10-30 23:11:30 | One of the new places opened in Calcutta. This place has a great view of the city with good music. When I say good music, I mean music in the background and you can hear the person sitting opposite to you. The service is spot on. The servers attend to you first and do not chit chat in a corner. Now the food, ordered a farmers pizza which was good enough for an evening snack. The best thing that happened during the evening was the hookah. It was so smooth yet gave the kick. After a very long had really good hookah. The price pinch is moderate too. Would definitely visit more often now. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Agrawal | 1902980 | 4.5 | 2016-10-30 00:43:02 | Since its opening, have been there couple of times already. The evening view of the city is definitely one of the the ups of the place.¬†
The ambience is awesome and the right kind of classy touch interiors makes you want to come n relax with friends.¬†
The mocktails were good, and some dishes mentioning special mention are Chilli Cheese dragons, Med platter, Falafel Sliders and Mobar Laksa.¬†
Thanks Avantika for bringing the Monkey to town. :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Divya Khettry | 1930204 | 4.0 | 2016-10-29 12:09:30 | Finally the Monkey swings East! Must day amazing ambience and view. Drinks were great too the only thing I didn't like here was the food its a little average. I also loved the music all my fav tracks were played. |
 
Monkey Bar | Tushar Goyal | 1881622 | 4.5 | 2016-10-29 10:47:35 | Unluckily I ended up to the place on a Thursday and it was a dry day there, but the food was phenomenal . The moment you see the menu you want to try everything .

We ordered loaded nacho was very good , beet and orange salad which was ok , kimchi baby potatoes is a must try.
For the mains I ordered paneer kichdi which was good and the soulful bowl chilly paneer was good too. 

Going to go again for the non- veg very soon . |
 
Monkey Bar | Komal Agarwal | 34017613 | 3.5 | 2016-10-27 19:38:37 | The only good part about this place was the ambience and picturesque settings. Food is nothing worth mentioning. The spaghetti pasta was bad. Spring rolls & nachos were okay. Among the drinks, I really liked the Virgin Mangaa. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pragya | 1712349 | 3.0 | 2016-10-26 16:50:18 | Ambience - Good

Monkey Bar | Chandramouli Daga | 15803042 | 4.0 | 2016-10-24 20:41:36 | A sensational space with a terrific view of the Calcutta skyline. While it is expensive and the cocktails might not cater to everyone, the food is experimantally delicious while the service is admirable. 

Happening! And how! |
 
Monkey Bar | Moumita Das Talukdar | 343640 | 4.0 | 2016-10-24 20:01:03 | Visited this place at Fort Knox building 9th floor- the new outlet to party with friends. Gorgeous interiors and a stellar reputation as a chain we went there with high expectations and we were satisfied.Spectacular view with good music and awsum food. Innovative cocktails , lipsmacking pork and beef dishes.A must try joint. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anurag Jaiswal | 1778047 | 4.5 | 2016-10-24 18:14:19 | Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox building. The food & service are excellent. Ambiance is awesome. Per pax-Rs.1000 with drinks (inclusive of taxes) |
 
Monkey Bar | Sanjay Bhowmik | 29528004 | 4.0 | 2016-10-23 23:36:21 | I think I would rate this place 95% purely for the ambience and the view....the truly quintessential bar and cafe where you can have an awesome conversation at an awesome side table with an awesome view of the metropolis named Kolkata that I am yet to see anywhere in this city....truth be told, I was bedazzled and enamoured by the view....a whole 6/5!!!

Then comes the hard reality....for the few drinks (7), couple of coffee and a few bites, it was almost ‚Çπ4.2k....time to pay for the view!!!!....maybe a tinge more so 3.5/5....but the few hours spent are worth sitting there provided the company / conversation is good....

Nothing to write home about the food taste, just an avg 3.5/5

In the evening they have a good lighting set up and inspite of the crowd, every table and it's occupants had their own space and not intruded upon....it didn't feel cluttered like other such hallmark Kolkatan joints....would have gone for a 4.5/5 but they totally managed to screw that up with thumping music, which could have been easily done through the softer and low volume lounge music!!!...killed the evening ambience....if the idea was to attract the vibrant gen then they missed the fact that there were a whole lot of couples and a few bunch who were engrossed in their own conversation and seemed a bit irritated with the thumping bass....so here's a 3/5 for ruining the awesome layout and view....

If I would ever come again, it would be for the view and the window seats....but guys, do get some class in the music, the environment should provide for individual space, the layout, lighting, setting and ambience are awesome but your music settings are truly questionable, at least this time round!!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Gupta | 29595954 | 3.0 | 2016-10-23 14:58:41 | I didnt have the food since i wanted north indian cuisine and they dnt serve the same where as Zomato says they serve north indian.... ambience was excellent.... |

Monkey Bar | Sunanda Ghosh | 2720210 | 4.0 | 2016-10-20 12:21:51 | The newest addition to Camac Street, Monkey bar holds the promise of becoming one of the coolest hangouts for GenY. Situated on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building, it offers a panoramic view of the city through huge glass windows and what's more there's even arrangement for outdoor seating. The decor is charming and an awesome background score makes the ambience perfect for chilling out with your friends over great food and drinks. Firstly we ordered a butterfly chicken and duck pita pockets. The chicken was delicious and crispy tossed with bell peppers, chilli flakes and stuffed in crunchy butterfly shells and the duck meat marinated with spices and packed inside soft pita bread created fireworks in our mouths. We also went for a smoked chicken, chicken salami and harissa pizza which was superb, to say the least. There was another Hearty bowl, a heartwarming chicken broth with bean sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, flat noodles and bokchoy sprinkled with chilli oil. We finished off with Mobar Sundae Sandwich, an ice cream cake with nuts layered with nutella and tutti fruti. We also tried their hookah and the shisha is really good and strong. The service is more of less..efficient and the staff polite..but the pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side. They recently acquired their bar license, so would love to drop in again for a taste of their cocktails! |
 
Monkey Bar | Pamela Nandi | 2821382 | 3.0 | 2016-10-20 01:06:16 | No doubt this place has an amazing ambience with an indoor and outdoor seating area styled in the form of british pub, but food and service is very very poor.¬† We went on ashtami night with friends, they took about an hour to prepare the chicken stacked as saslik to grill it. Once served, the dish was just tasteless. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sunrita Sarkar | 804376 | 5.0 | 2016-10-18 22:44:36 | Hi, if you love Calcutta , good music(and by good music I mean led zeppelin and pink flyod and classics as such ) and a brilliant view of Calcutta, this is the place to be. 

We ordered a pack up punch, Sangria and a 100 pipers based cocktail. All three were pretty different and pretty well made. 

We didn't order any food as we were so engrossed in the decor and view. 

The hospitality was brilliant. 

Do give it a visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Aritra Roy | 145459 | 4.5 | 2016-10-17 22:31:23 | Already visited twice in such a short span of opening its doors in Kolkata, Monkey Bar has been fabulous on both occasions. Situated on the top floor of Fort Knox, it provides a magnificent view of the Kolkata skyline with Victoria Memorial, St Pauls Cathedral, Hooghly bridge and the 42 which is the tallest building here.

The food has been great and is presented in a unique way. Ordered Chilli Cheese dragons, Mac and cheese croquettes, Butterfly chicken and Chicken Chimichurri on the first time along with Mangaa mocktail. On the repeat, we ordered Mobar caramel ribs, Tiger beef, Reddys popcorn chicken alongwith a Smoked chicken pizza. In drinks, we had copper monkey , house made ginger beer with a couple of KF ultras.

However special mention must go to the desserts, Snicker bar is just too good while Nolen gur creme brulee was delicious.
They have a small open air area for hookah as well. The service is prompt and the ambience is quite relaxing. The bar looks pretty while the music changes over time with comforting tracks during evening to partying ones as the night progresses on.

Overall, the Kolkata gastropub scene is proud to have Monkey bar in its lineup. Hope it gets better from here.Cant wait to visit soon again :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Rupsha Bhadra | 606325 | 4.5 | 2016-10-16 14:33:22 | Monkey bar in Delhi is a location that is a part of some very special memories so I had really high expectations from its Calcutta counterpart. It certainly did not disappoint. We ordered loaded chicken nachos, the butter chicken kichdi, smoked chicken pizza and others. The butter chicken khichdi was really impressive. So were the cocktails Maanga and Copper monkey. A little on the higher side when it comes to the pocket pinch, monkey bar did live up to all the expectations. And the view is just fantastic. |
 
Monkey Bar | Madhurya Sarkar | 6309371 | 5.0 | 2016-10-16 12:11:35 | Just loved it.
The ambiance, the playlist, the skyline view, the staff management, the food and everything is just superb of this pub. This is located in the 9th floor of Knox building opposite to Urban desi. We visited late afternoon but the best time would be to hit this place in the evening. This can be an ideal place to go a date with your partner :)
The view of St. Paul's Cathedral, Victoria Memorial and Hooghly Bridge adds flavour to their ambiance.
Coming to food we had kingfisher premium beer, chicken wings and chocolate lava cake. All of the dishes were value for money. Overall had an excellent experience.
Coming back soon :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Syed Murtaza Jafar | 32607152 | 5.0 | 2016-10-16 04:52:57 | Ok, so same night we visited The Great Booze Story and Monkey Bar, and I'll say Monkey Bar won big time. Just opposite Urban Desi (will visit soon), good collection of music, courteous and attentive staff, this is one venue that you would want to visit again. The ambience, the view of the The Victoria Memorial is just a sight to look at. Safe to say, I'll be coming back to this place soon |
 
Monkey Bar | Preity | 27451267 | 4.5 | 2016-10-15 21:30:28 | Rare does it happen that you get good food at a bar and by the ambience of this place i expected nothing different..but to my surprise it was a very delightful experience..superbbbb food..good music, not too loud so you can chit chat with your friends..and very courteous staff..overall a very good experience..definitely coming back and soon... |

Monkey Bar | Sankha Sengupta | 1733759 | 4.0 | 2016-10-14 17:13:36 | Been there yesterday night. Had soft to you guys, you people just amazed me by your friendly hospitality.
Specialty thanks to Joy you made my evening remarkable. Monkey people should be proud to have a manager like you. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rashmi Adhikary | 31014016 | 4.5 | 2016-10-14 14:26:12 | We visited Monkey Bar on Saptami evening, and had a spectacular time. The ambience is lively, the music is great, the decor very impressive and the service commendable.  
Now coming to the sumptuous meal; an assortment of drinks - whiskey, tequila, rum, virgin mojita, espresso -  was ordered with starters being Butterfly Chicken and Chicken Chapli. Yes, Butterfly Chicken is a definitely worth a try. In the main course, there was Aunty Vinnie's Berry Pulao. Tiger Beef was so delicious that two more dishes were ordered; this is must-try for beef lovers. This is the first place in Kolkata that I see so many beef dishes being offered. Galouti Killer was the other beef dish ordered and equally palatable. I had Mee Goreng which is an Indonesian dish of spiced noodles and got it topped with chicken. 
Overall, it was a great experience in this newly-opened gastropub. |
 
Monkey Bar | Piyush Dalmia | 15726652 | 4.5 | 2016-10-13 20:42:49 | Another fab newbie in the city

Talk about the Ambience, Food, Service or the Decor, it excels in all

Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building at Camac Street, it offers a spectacular view of the city
 
The Decor and Seating Arrangements are well made 

They got a separate smoking area which is quite airy, and has ample seating space as well

Shisha was pretty decent and lasted quite a while

Now lets talk about the protagonist here

Nachos were crisp and loaded with cheese, the Platter was appealing and featured variety of items whereas the mocktails were on fleek 

But things which really caught our attention were Spaghetti and Paneer Khidchi

While the former was extremely tasty, the latter is a MUST have dish for sure

All in all, it was a happy dining experience for us |
 
Monkey Bar | Arpita Agarwal | 998579 | 4.5 | 2016-10-13 12:39:47 | A new place in town, much awaited. Great ambience! The view is also super!! Maybe they should have had a slightly larger rooftop area. Food is decent too. The nachos were pretty good. The Manga is a must try!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sharmistha Mukherjee | 722185 | 4.5 | 2016-10-12 06:49:58 | If you are in Calcutta and love the skyline and a few drinks to go along with it on a hot, rainy or crisp evening this is the place to be. Monkey Bar in Calcutta is done up beautifully and affords you a view of the Victoria Memorial, St Paul's Cathedral and the Hoogly Bridge. The have cocktails and food over and above what they offer in other cities. The hipster smash is delicious to say the least. As was the bourbon cocktail with almond bitters... |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohit Suryawanshi | 36318376 | 5.0 | 2016-10-11 18:11:29 | My favourite lalmass Takos ,Pizza and Delicious Chillie cheese Dragon.
The friendliness of the staff seems genuine. I have never seen such good customer service as I experienced. |
 
Monkey Bar | FOODBUFFS | 987893 | 4.0 | 2016-10-11 11:16:14 | Visited on Ashtami night.Even though it was a good crowd,we managed to get a table immediately,courtesy to the experienced and efficient management team.There is an open-air seating which mainly caters to people ordering hookah or going there for a puff.Indoor seating is quite large.
Decor is akin to a British pub.Upholstery is comfortable.What allures you are those French windows through which you can catch a great glimpse of the city skyline,from the ninth floor.In the evenings there is muted lighting.Ambience is quite good.We heard some good old day soft music but as the night grew,the DJ started giving groovy yet classy numbers.
Service is warm and polite but there was a lack of professionalism.We were giving the same food order to two or three different men at times.The servers,even though quite courteous,were not quite clearly conversant about the food and beverages,unless asked upon.Details or any recommendations/suggestions were not given on their own.They need to more vocal  and well informed about every detail of the food when the order is being placed.
PAN RASNA HOOKAH-strong flavour,no choking but the smoke was quite weak,unlike to our liking.It was smooth but the smoke didnot last for an hour.It wasnot worth the price charged.Not satisfied.
BUTTERFLY CHICKEN-tastewise quite impressive.Chicken morsels were soft and had a sweet tangy taste.The sauce was pretty good and spicy and the butterfly shells were crispy,the whole presentation looked lovely.Three butterflies were there.
REDDY'S CHICKEN POPCORN-Well this dish took us to South India.Moderately sized chicken morsels deep fried in a batter having a crisp crunchy texture and the taste was so consistent in southern flavours,it tasted good.Curry leaves flavour was predominant and we liked it a lot to go for a second order.
CHICKEN CHIMICHURI-Chicken was soft.They were skewed up but the flavours were quite bland,didnot stand up to our expectations.Not impressive at all,this dish needs improvement.
MEDITERRANEAN PLATTER-Mixed comments.It was great in some parts,not so great in others.Chickpea fries were not so good to taste,seemed a bit too fried where the chickpea stuffing was too less.The pita breads were nice,soft,fluffy,buttered and nicely grilled,tasted good.Hummus was in great quantity,tastewise perfect but the babaghanoush didnot stand out in taste.Cheese filo wraps tasted good.They  had soft spinach with gooey cheese inside wrapped in rice papers and fried.Overall a good dish,you can give it a try if Mediterranean cuisine is your calling.
OLD MONK(EY) CHOCOLATE CAKE-Good.Cake was melt in mouth soft and creamy.Consistency of cream was smooth,light and fluffy.The dessert was classy,superb and hence recommended.
Foodwise we were not that satisfied as much as we were with their cocktails!!
Their BOURBON LIIT,MAD MEN and MAMA'S GIRL were just bang on!The bartender did a great job.The blend was great,the liquor gave a great kick,courtesy the good mixing.They were well balanced in flavours and the ingredients of the drinks very well complimented each other.Spices and mint went well with vodka,and coffee with whisky surely made a great pair.
We also ordered Heineken,Ginger ale and fresh lime soda which was usual.
As far as price is concerned,it is too high for the food and some cocktails! Quantity of food is very less,so doesnot justify the price and tastewise it didnot make a good mark.The cocktails had a price tag which was same as most gastropubs having a good establishment cost,yet they were high.
This pub is a must visit,esp for their awsome cocktails.The gastronome part needs improvement to call it a fair gastropub.Will visit again for sure owing to the overall good experience that we had,a good hangout place and to try other cocktails and entr√©es. |
 
Monkey Bar | Garima Poddar | 2714062 | 3.5 | 2016-10-10 23:22:48 | The ambience n decor is nice..I had ordered fr a peach icetea n it was quite refreshing..the chilli cheese dragon was nt that impressive n lacking chilli..onion n capsicum basically the description was amazing bt it was no where near that..nachos was average..spaghetti in red sauce was again average..green thai curry was really nice n d best part was d dessert mobar sundae sandwhch it was like love at first bite |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohit Misra | 1561408 | 4.5 | 2016-10-10 11:32:08 | Monkey bar has lived upto the expectations. With crazy ambience and amazing service, it just became my favourite destination in town. Also on a special note, Ripon out there was brilliant with his service. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rima Dhara | 1796261 | 2.5 | 2016-10-09 20:08:51 | Nothing great... service is very bad... food is ok.. ambiance is good ... but as a whole coz of service of of the worst place I have ever been.... will not try again ‚òπÔ∏è chicken wasn't fresh... very bad experience ... |
 
Monkey Bar | Sreyashi M. | 10853321 | 4.5 | 2016-10-09 19:05:16 | Visited today for lunch, and a had a lovely time! 
I suggest you get a table by the windows. The Kolkata skyline will definitely make your visit even more memorable. 
We tried the Maanga cocktail (5 stars, peeps!) with the Tiger Beef. I suggest you try both. Succulent meat with the zing of your drink makes for some very happy (read: tipsy) people. 
For mains, we tried the Mobar burger and it was heavenly! The Naga pork soulful bowl was fabulous too! Portions are great, flavour is gorgeous and staff is super sweet and nice. 
I hope you maintain what you've got going so I can visit again! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sudipto Mitra | 2401672 | 3.5 | 2016-10-09 09:00:39 | Nice decor , awsum view of the cityscape and great cocktails . Food is good to average with a twist and may not be liked by all.
We ordered pitchers of pack a punch,mangaa amd mohjito and the first is the best.

We stuck with finger food only and ordered 
Mushroom bruschetta(good),prawn pil pil(gr8), chicken churi(avg) and tiger beef(gr8)
Rounded everything off with aunty berry pulao which was delicious
 This a typical gastro bar with foot tapping music which is too loud at times, we had to ask it to be turned down.

The service could have been bettet and there  was confusion while seating. We were waiting at the bar for our table to be ready but some other guests jumped on that

Oh forgot to mention a outing here will surely burn a whole in your pocket |
 
Monkey Bar | Vedant Kabra | 2240676 | 4.5 | 2016-10-09 08:47:40 | I went to monkey bar last night and I was pretty surprised. Read all the reviews and thoroughly analysed the place in my mind before I went there (it's what I do). 
The guy at the front desk (I believe he was the owner) was phenomenal. So welcoming, so easy going and so 'approachable'. The one at the front desk is the face of any restaurant. He told us we'll have to wait for 40, but we got a table in 20. Told us we'll have to share the table - but eventually we didn't have to. 
I think seating right outside the kitchen + bar worked for us. Didn't have to wait for the food (the cheese drum, nachos and mushroom + truffle oil pizza are INSANE). Ordered quite a bit on the liquor front - barring the martini everything else was really good (fun presentation too!) (including the ginger beer). We had heard so much about the desserts - total let down though (chocolava cake with mint ice cream was terrible I must confess - Mezzuna gets the big ups here). 
The staff was pretty alright (looked a little confused at times). 
Monkey bar must work on guest management (but it is only a few weeks old so it's okay). Thoroughly impressed with the ambience (trumps Mezzuna and all the other hot spots in the city several times over), food, booze and service. 
This place has my highest recommendation. |
 
Monkey Bar | Argha Basu | 1892606 | 5.0 | 2016-10-08 15:46:45 | If you want to impress your girlfriend or wife . Just take her there . Take your seat next to the glass wall and enjoy the panaromic view of the Victoria memorial, Vidyasagar Setu and the Howrah Bridge.

Monkey Bar | Puja Das | 36272619 | 4.5 | 2016-10-08 12:52:12 | Bookmarks . ¬†It's got an amazing atmosphere with outdoor and indoor seating. Despite going on the weekend it gets the right amount of crowd that makes it a very happening place. Music was really good. We wanted to try a new cocktail, so we went for the ¬†toast to calcutta which was a little different and tasted quite good. Food on the other hand was quite unique. 
service is also impressed us. ¬† ¬†

The place is a little hard to find. But overall it's a nice place for the weekend chill! |
 
Monkey Bar | Tejash | 15384381 | 1.5 | 2016-10-08 11:33:48 | Visited this place on 7th October with friends. We were a group of 11 but there is no place for such big group there.  The table we were given was ideal for 7 but we had to squeeze in.  Repeated request for chair felt to deaf ears till such time my friend pulled up the bar chair from the adjacent table. They have limited staff and one server was alloted to the tables.  Needless to say the service was pathetic and totally unacceptable. Our order for beer and ginger ale took 30 mins and after repeated reminders it arrived.  The food is average with limited option for Vegetarian. No one wants to eat "baigan pakora " or " vada pav" at such a place.  We were charged for one item that was ordered but not served. On pointing the same the server "argued" that we didn't realise but it was indeed served to us.  In no mood to hang around any more we just paid and left.  While waiting down for our car we met others who too were very disappointed with the place. 

This will be one of those places in kolkata that will soon be ticked off based on word or mouth and customer experience because of shabby service and attitude of the people who run it. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anshuman Jalan | 31752408 | 2.0 | 2016-10-08 00:20:08 | Good atmoshpere ! Average food for vegie lovers ! Place to chill and soak in the music and buzz around . Nothing home to write about the food . And weekend and holidays . aVOID as unable to give service due to rush |
 
Monkey Bar | Darshana Rampuria | 2855224 | 3.5 | 2016-10-05 11:34:14 | So finally visited Monkey Bar ! The ambience is good as compared to What we get to see in Kolkata.. but apart from that nothing spectacular and surely cannot be compared to the one in Mumbai ! The food is Too average . We had ordered the Nachos - this one was a disaster , pesto spaghetti ( penne pasta wasn't there!!) - yet again very bland and just not up to the mark . Though tempura and mezze platter was good BUT the Coconut ice cream Dessert was FABULOUS SO an extra 0.50 points for that !! Food needs to be worked upon , staff is courteous ! Best wishes .. hoping my next visit be better and with no complains ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sujan Das | 36218418 | 4.5 | 2016-10-03 14:04:44 | I went this place with my friends and I would say this was amazing and was full packed in the weekend without liquor. There ambiance was very good and the music they place is also very nice . There drinks where also very good . They smoking and non smoking area also which was the best part of this place. Good place to spend with your friends. As we been to many other bars but I love this place as they have place to sit and there service was also excellent. They where pack but still there people know how to attend the gust which was very good in this bar. Pocket friendly and staff was excellent smiling and they working and they suggest also if you are new to this place and don't know what to order. I would suggest everyone for this place and sure you will be in love with this place. I basically tried everything on the menu (food and beverage), and yes it is all worth every penny
, I m fan of there menu and food, really enjoyed.¬†

Monkey Bar | Soul !! | 32140714 | 4.5 | 2016-10-03 08:50:51 | In a word, wonderful. We been to Delhi Monkey but this is the best one with wonderful view. 
One thing we really missed the Foosball) 
But no matter we had great time, fantastic food, we order lot many things forget the name but pizza and starters are yumm, drinks are also really nice
Staff were very welcoming too.

So keep good work guys !! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sarat | 8743511 | 3.0 | 2016-10-03 01:16:59 | ambience is good.. was excited to reach the place.. view n open air is also impressive.. u get a glimpse of the Victoria memorial
Although can't talk about the cocktails(coz we wet on 2nd oct, dry day), but we had the copper monkey mocktail and a ginger beer, we were very happy with both
But sadly food was extremely disappointing.. taste as well as quality is not upto the mark.. ordered the much talked about chicken butterfly, too sweet, no flavour of chicken n tasted Lyk beans on toast
Second ordered the spicy tomato spaghetti, worst I hav ever had, tasted like Maggi with tomato
Butter chicken khichadi was good,,, good innovation
Snickerbar, dessert, was well mind blowing if u hav a sweet tooth.. very nice and balanced taste
But the whole dining experience was not satisfactory |
 
Monkey Bar | Nikita Ramgarhia | 903737 | 2.5 | 2016-10-01 10:11:42 | An over hyped place.
The only plus points are the ambience and the service.
The hookah is average and food simply disappoints.
The vada pao is good.
The Mac and cheese croquettes have peas in them..like who does peas with cheese and Mac..
Too bad with the experimentation guys..
And the potato rackett is also very bland.
Galauti is average..
You guys are better in other cities I have heard..so pls improve in Kolkata |
 
Monkey Bar | Bindu | 36159071 | 3.5 | 2016-09-29 00:55:19 | At last chef manu chandra with his concept of monkey bar has entered in Kolkata.but sorry to say the food and service has dissapointed on comparison with the monkey bars in bombay and bangalore.
Need to check before its too late its my first experience but once more will love to try so that they can still improvise. |
 
Monkey Bar | Harish Todi | 1076456 | 2.0 | 2016-09-28 00:28:12 | The place is worst ever in all places that I do visit. What it seems from outside is not at all from inside. It's totally a different one and thats very disappointing for me. The hookah was so bad that I just left it after once. It was all a waste of money for me and that too a huge waste as it is very costly as per their brand name , but it's sad to say that it couldn't carry it'd brand name at all. |
 
Monkey Bar | Hardik Daga || Kolkata Epicurean | 9516701 | 4.0 | 2016-09-26 23:52:06 | Location-Fort knox building(9th floor),Camac street.

Finally "Monkey bar" has opened its gate to kolkata.After establishing itself in Mumbai,Delhi and Bangalore its opening in kolkata was much awaited.This place is totally a fresh take on gastrobar culture.As we entered we were totally astonished with the beauty of this place.The best part about this place was the swanky interiors and the dazzling view.The menu was mouthwatering and creation of one of the finest chef Manu Chandra.But along with whole lot of positive aspects this place has its negative side too and that is its service and price.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is extremely calm and soothing.The interiors are extremely high-toned.The place is divided into two sections(Smoking and Non Smoking area)which is appreciated.And atlast for this segment,we can bet that this place has the best view in comparison to any of the eateries in Kolkata.

Service-We were extremely disappointed with the service at this place.The staff was extremely confused with our seating.They took about 15 minutes to make us sit and also the table on which we were seated was already reserved by someone due to which we have to change our table in between.We also have to urge them many a times to serve us water and take the order for the food.But on the other side we saw that the staff was trained very well with the dishes and helped us to choose the right dishes according to our starvation.

Food-The food at this place was good in taste but what astonished us the most was their presentation,it was just praise-worthy.We had-
1:Med platter
2:Spicy panner bhurji buns
3:Chilli cheese dragons

Among them our favourite was "Med platter".We also had sheesha at this place which we find extremely expensive.It cost us around 800+taxes.

Food-4/5
Service-3/5
Ambiance-4.5/5

Monkey Bar | Ritwika Pal | 172912 | 4.0 | 2016-09-26 10:27:27 | Woo another gastropub in town, I was super excited to explore this new place. Unfortunately they not yet started with alcohol. But yes for compensation they have this Non alcoholic beer in their menu card. Which is more like a ginger ale.¬†
Food is awesome we tried Sticky Korean Chicken Wings and Prawn Pil Pil for which is can give 5/5. |

Monkey Bar | Vikash Kumar Singh | 32056738 | 2.0 | 2016-09-25 23:21:32 | Went to this place on 25th of September. The best part of this hotel is the view of Victoria + Vidyasagar Setu. Food is ok types. Service needs to improve. Didnt like that much. |
 
Monkey Bar | Shakshi Bajaj | 34222951 | 4.0 | 2016-09-25 21:50:03 | Had recently visited the place.  Ambience was really good.  Soothing music and ample space worked well for me.  All the people were very courteous and response was very quick. We ordered nachos,  potato with rachlette cheese and pizza.  The food was yummmm. We asked for out of the menu toppings for pizza and they were more than happy to serve.  It was a pleasant experience. |
 
Monkey Bar | Samrat Banerjee | 984442 | 3.0 | 2016-09-25 18:48:36 | Visited the place on 24Sep. A mix of pro's and cons. Remarkably expensive, considering service is yet to reach premium standards. Yet to get a bar license, staff seems confused about where to seat you if you walk in as a couple. While the outdoor sitting layout is nice, it's primarily used as a hookah space by boisterous youngsters, and the seating layout is remarkably cramped. Service also is a minus here with the server not asking or serving water if not called to do so. Portions are quite small against the charges. Chicken Chimichuri was good, folks lovers which was 3 cutlets of bhekti coated and fried was ok. The mushroom pizza was definitely a let down. With 2 soft drinks the tab came to ‚Çπ1650+. Not worth a revisit soon. |
 
Monkey Bar | Abhishek Agarwal | 2897244 | 3.5 | 2016-09-25 03:13:53 | Was on the bucket list since it opened... So
We ordered a hookah but it failed my expectations... We tried out the tacos which was really nice... Service was on the slower side.... Definitely a lot to improve..
But then having ur food wit hookah nd Victoria memorial to look over.. The view is breathtaking..
But u need to live up to the name...
Hope to b back soon.... Nd wish to see a Better Trained Monkeyüëç |

Monkey Bar | Shourya Sengupta | 2357486 | 4.5 | 2016-09-23 21:51:57 | Brilliant food! Loved the wide choice of meat. Please keep up the good work! Look forward to having the Galouti Killer, next time since it was not available. |
 
Monkey Bar | Siddhi Newatia | 3761881 | 3.0 | 2016-09-23 21:24:05 | Amazing ambience..very spacious, drinks menu could Hav had more variety..hated the mangaa drink..i found it too sour..the pizza and chilli cheese dragons were good. |
 
Monkey Bar | Harsh Bathwal | 1481844 | 3.5 | 2016-09-21 23:42:47 | Visited here for the first time. The food menu is different from what you come across usually in other restaurants. I think it's a perfect date spot as it has a beautiful Victoria building's view which looks amazing at night. Also the music was superb.
Pocket pinch : 600-700 per head. ( Food and mocktail) |
 
Monkey Bar | Shikha Ojha | 2112728 | 4.5 | 2016-09-18 01:48:05 | Amazing decor and awesome food. They had an outdoor sitting too which had a big screen playing Mickie and Minnie black and white cartoon synchronized with the songs being played. The cost is on the higher side but if you want to pamper yourself or people you love, this is the place to be. The amazing view is icing on the cake. |
 
Monkey Bar | Utsav Agarwal | 31137221 | 1.5 | 2016-09-17 22:49:13 | There is a difference in Bangalore wen it compares to Kolkata one , seriously don't no d reason but it needs to upgrade it very soon as in Bangalore. 
Specifically, the property is pretty old for a brand like dis 
According to me Monkey bar is just not another lounge but a more of a culture which in itself |
 
Monkey Bar | Arnav Jhunjhunwala | 22857974 | 5.0 | 2016-09-16 21:28:37 | The best place to hangout now. Food quality is excellent and many of the dishes aren't available anywhere in Kolkata. The key lime pie is unbelievable and a must have each time you go. |
 
Monkey Bar | Tanya Sen | 496614 | 5.0 | 2016-09-15 00:44:28 | The moment you walk in to this restaurant you're going to notice the long french windows and ofcourse the most beautiful view which includes victoria memorial. The ambience is lovely, very warm and urban. We ordered Aam Pannas, Tiger beef, Prawn Ghee Roast, Pepper Calamari. All of them were to die for. For dessert we ordered Nolen gurer creme br√ªl√©e. Yumm yumm!! I would totally come again. Loved itüòä |
 
Monkey Bar | Sourav Mukherjee | 306717 | 4.5 | 2016-09-14 11:38:19 | Finally they have arrived in Kolkata after rocking Delhi , Mumbai , Bangalore etc. and a few of Corporate Monkeys could muster the courage and had enough stock of lame excuses (for residential purposes only) to visit this joint on the lazy Saturday afternoon last week. Very conveniently located at Camac Street , innovative food & drinks menu like Kerala Rice , Butterfly Chicken , Prawn Pil Pil and many more.¬† Personally I loved the ginger beer. It was a full house and it is nice to see that City of Joy has lapped up the Monkey Bar and the legendary versatile gastronomical journey of Kolkata has just added yet another feather . Must visit joint for foodies and a great place to unwind. Wishing luck and Highly recommended !!!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Siddhartha Chowdhary | 211170 | 4.0 | 2016-09-14 00:31:42 | Dim lights and chic interiors. A totally fresh take on gastropub culture. The place was almost full when we entered so 9 of us had to accommodate on a smaller table. They weren't serving alcohol today, and for the next few days also they are keeping the bar closed. we had to compromise on that and had to order the virgins. We had the much hyped 'maanga' which was nice and refreshing. Homemade ginger beer was good. Brownie cookie shake wasn't available. For starters we had chilli cheese dragons, cheese filled cigar rolls with spicy garlic sauce, the sauce was amazing. Rock Corn tempura was good, crisp and the teriyaki sauce was appropriately done. Loaded nachos was amazing. Potato with raclette which was fried potatoes topped with stringy mozzarella cheese, was basic and slightly spiced toped with pickled jalape√±os. We also ordered two types of pizza , roasted zucchini with parmesan and tomatoes and the other, mushrooms with truffle oil. I loved the mushroom one over the zucchini one. But the pizza looked a bit messy and wasn't also evenly crisp. Overall the service was spontaneous and amiable. I liked the overall experience though. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Chopra | 34103337 | 4.5 | 2016-09-13 20:44:04 | Monkey Bar is a grown up version of a slightly more casual neighborhood bar. With about 300+ gastro pubs in India it is only a matter of time when people start aping. The Calcutta version is setting it apart from the rest of the so called gastro pubs.

We had the good fortune of going to the private opening of Monkey Bar Kolkata on the 1st September, 2016. It was a small party for about a 100 people. The mood was up beat and there was a sense of relief and satisfaction on the staff who were hosting us. It has taken Monkey Bar Kolkata a little over 8 months to complete the restaurant.

The staff is from all across the country. This makes for some good interaction with them ‚Äì that is if you care to chat them up. The cocktails are more involved. There is reasonable work that is done to create the drinks behind the counter. Work as in ingredients have been mixed and labor have been put in to create a concoction or mixes. Not just opening bottles and squirting premixes in a shaker and serving things up. Almost like an artisan touch. The bases are fermented in house; you can see the large glass jars filled and sitting happy on the bar counter.

To begins with the view is something you must visit let alone anything else. Add the food and you have method to mayhem. The care that goes in the food here is evident when you have your first bites. With Chef Manu Chandra at the helm of the kitchen things are definitely going to have certain standards in terms of flavor and quality. There is always going to be a reason behind why what ever has been done to the food in the kitchen here at Monkey Bar.

Expect massive flavors and good service. In fact it is so good to see the city opening up to the kinds of Monkey Bar. This is a place where you can come in and kick back with friends on a weekend. This is one tree that we two monkeys are happy to call home. |
 
Monkey Bar | Jayeeta Basu | 360426 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 21:01:52 | So finally Kolkata gets Monkey Bar!! 
I have always loved the Bangalore  and the Mumbai Monkey Bar because of the ambience.  
First day, the space and the view is amazing!! They had a very limited drinks menu considering first day. I had Toast to Calcutta, Manga and Copper Grin. Toast to Calcutta was refreshing, adding smoke gondhoraj lebu,  it tasted even better.  Manga is something I have drank before.  Copper Grin was okay. 
Let's get into the food menu.  Prawn ghee roast,  Vada Pav,  Keema Pav the menu took me back to Bombay and South. 
I had the Korean sticky wings,  since I already came to Monkey Bar  after having dinner,  I sticked to one starter and drinks!
I am planning to head back to Monkey Bar pretty soon for full fledged meal and lot of Toast to Calcutta! 
Please stock the bar as it is extremely disappointing to come to Monkey Bar and sit with limited choices in terms of alcohol. |
 
Monkey Bar | Arushi Dhupia | 1597321 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 19:14:22 | Monkey Bar is on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building on camac. Visit in the evening and if you're sitting by the window panes, you can see the Victoria Memorial, lights twinkling from The 42, and the outline of a part of the Parama flyover. It's so cool! 
The music is good and the place has a very funky feel to it. The food is good, not excellent. 
Loved the pizza and the Med platter.  Corn kernels were okayish. 
The Loaded Nachos were Brilliant!! Lots of sour cream and Mexican beans and fully loaded as the name suggests! No other places in kolkata (apart from the Big Nachos at |
 
Monkey Bar | Shhashee Churiwala | 2053496 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 23:48:39 | The newest hub in kolkata with different design and fresco depicting old kolkata. The giant size windows showing the serene skyline of the city. Exhaustive menu with both indian and international cuisine with a twist. Prompt service , great tasting dishes both starters and mains accompanied humble pricing. A great place to kill your hunger. All in all good experience after a long time. A must visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Aihik Barua | 1850614 | 3.5 | 2016-09-11 22:10:16 | This review might change. This post is influenced mostly due to the nonavailability of alcohol , and I did see two or three bottles of liquor , anyway , about the interiors and location , bloody superb amazing selection , love it , would suggest it anybody , the bartenders ( coke tenders üòÇ) seemed cocky , but it's a relief to see a high end restaurant serving beef, that's fresh and the it was good actually , would go again for the booze ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Mansi Tulshan | 33240285 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 21:17:40 | Went there in the evening today to check out all the hype surrounding it. Guess what! Wasn't disappointed at all. We took a seat right next to the window(yes, I have a fascination for tables next to Windows) and was mesmerised by the breathtaking view of the city. The music, ambience were perfect for a chilled out evening with a great date(note:my husband).
The lemon iced tea was very good.. Perfect in taste. The staff recommended ' the med platter 'as a great vegetarian option and we decided to try that. The platter had falafel, pita pockets, cheese and spinach filos, and the usual dips. The hummus was great and we were serves a hearty portion if it which made us happy coz it's the dips which usually are heroes of this dish. The babagonoush was great and it had a smokey taste which was really good. The curd and cucumber dip definitely needs improvement. It was runny and tasted like buttermilk! Had no taste and we left most of it. The best part of the ambience was hookah had a separate enclosure and wasn't served inside the main restaurant! Will definitely return to this place for a relaxing evening! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sajid Feroz | 60540 | 1.0 | 2016-09-11 17:20:01 | New place and pathetic service....guy at the reception refused to give a table coz I was alone and suggested a table outside in open when it was so  hot outside.After a while I was a given a table with no seat n ws suggested to stand n eat (brilliant!) Although after some protest a seat was provided.i even noticed couples were asked to share a table even when some of the tables were empty ! It was quite bizzare !! imagine going on a double date with some strangers ! It was like they just wanted to give table to group of 4 or more ,again like I said restaurant was not even full!

Food was served ..I ordered a prawn dish ,peach ice tea and the snicker bar for dessert.prawn dish was good ,the ice tea wasn't served n after 45 minutes of ordering I was told it's not available .the snicker bar was good (recommended) !! Some how all the servers were lost in their own world ,roaming around in groups n hardly paying attention to customers ..that too when there was no rush at all ! 
 
I am not tat critical while writing reviews but m quite surprised how casual the staff was while handling their customers (that too being a new place in town).I have been to monkey bar in Delhi and tat place is amazing ! 

Service - 0/5
Decor -4/5 (lovely view of Victoria memorial n hoogly bridge ) 
Food - 3.5 (would love to explore more) 

Must have - the snicker bar |
 
Monkey Bar | Aadarsh Agarwal | 1183989 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 17:18:45 | The ambience and location of the place was top notch. With the bar not licensed yet the food surely compensated. There is a separate outdoor section for shisha takers. Lastly, the view of Victoria was the cherry on the cake. |
 
Monkey Bar | Reevu Wangdi | 284286 | 5.0 | 2016-09-11 00:42:46 | Great place to chill & dine... best thing is they serve beef...Tiger beef was succulent and spiced to perfection... Korean bulgogi beef rice was flavoursome ... chorizo pork pav was delicious... ampanna done right... and service was tops... gonna be back when the bar opens ..I believe next week it is... good going .. |
 
Monkey Bar | Devanshi Powani | 33090142 | 3.5 | 2016-09-10 23:54:27 | The snicker bar desert and the Aam aadmi eggs were the highlight of our dinner. Can't wait for the bar to start . Loved the service and the ambience. |
 
Monkey Bar | Jashita Ray | 589467 | 4.0 | 2016-09-09 19:52:29 | Had been waiting eagerly for the opening of Monkey Bar and there I was dragging my fiance, paying a visit in the first week itself. However I would say i rather got slightly disappointed. The staff seemed amateur. They were very amiable but highly confused. Firstly it took them over 20-25mins with repetitive reminders to serve us water. And further disappointment was on asking for the drinks menu, they informed us they didn't have license for alcohol. Thus we had to settle for mocktails. The person who took our mocktail order was so confused. He was unsure of the mocktails on offer, we had to specifically cue him with names like green apple or blue lagoon etc. And oh, there was no paper napkins, spoons and forks or sauces kept on the table for us as some had mentioned in previous reviews - we had to ask for them. Probably they don't have them kept in advance in the open air section.
Now the good part - Everything else!
The ambience - Wow. The view of the Victoria Memorial is simply stunning. You can just sit and spend hours adoring your surroundings.
We ordered a teen paan hookah, along with a Virgin Mangaa- Loved it and a Green Apple Soda which was decent, not that great. Next on our list were the Butterflies, Rooster Booster Burger & Chicken 65. The first two were mouthwatering, especially the burger - juicy, filling, yummilicious. And then the cherry on the pie - the dessert - Snicker bar- I genuinely recommend this. Loved the way they serve it and the taste is heavenly.
Overall, had a lovely evening with the MoBar Mojo! Just wished I could give it a 5 star rating. |
 
Monkey Bar | Luna Chatterjee (Madly_Food_Lover) | 1304639 | 4.5 | 2016-09-09 01:36:56 | The Monkey has finally swung east, and that too it's making it's presence felt !! After Mumbai and Delhi now Kolkata hasit own "Monkey Bar". 
To start with It's an amazing property that has a breathtaking view. You can just gaze at Kolkata skyline while sipping some amazing cocktails.
Curated by acclaimed chef Manu Chandra, Monkey Bar's menu boasts of innovative food and drinks. I absolutely loved each and everything that i tasted but some of the items and drinks need spl mention.
Kerala Rice Salad- A salad made with wild red rice, blended with herbs and topped with curd chilli, the dish is indigenous and light.
Med Platter-A dish which is a visual delight in itself apart from being a total amalgamation of fritters and dips.
Tikki of Joy- A perfect dish to satisfy the bong fish craving.
Butterfly Chicken- Chicken blended with herbs placed inside a butterfly shaped shell.
Prawn Pil Pil- Perfectly prepared Prawn served with bread. Simple yet delicious
Laal Maas Phulka Tacos-Rajasthani laal mash intelligently placed inside tacos, a perfect fusion food.
Spare Pork Ribs- This is ansolutely recommended for those pork lovers. The meat is tender and cooked to perfection in barbecue sauce.
The drinks served quenched our thirst perfectly, among them some needs spl mentionlike Manga, Copper Monkey, Pink Punch. 
The desserts are absolutely delightful.Gondhoraj Lemon Tart is sweet, with a bit of tang!! There is Snicker Bar whichbis total bliss.
So with the coming of Monkey Bar i can safely say that gastronomic revolution has indeed hit our City of Joy. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anamitraa/The Gut Filling | 671420 | 4.0 | 2016-09-09 00:46:21 | The City of Joy is witnessing a major change in the gastronomic culture post the technological revolution of smartphones and wireless technology. There has been evolution of the global food and Calcuttans are gradually getting used to it. After many multinational and national pubs coming to Kolkata, it was the turn for Monkey Bar to refresh Kolkata with its gracious presence.

This 3rd September, I was invited to the Pre Launch of the Kolkata Chapter where the #MonkeySwungEast. It was a lovely happy afternoon where all the foodies, bloggers, critics and experts had a gala time with beautiful cocktails, mocktails and great good.

The place is located at the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building in Camac Street. Blessed with a wonderful view, you can see the Victoria Memorial, St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral and Hooghly Bridge altogether. We had to pick up paper pieces with names of cocktails and sit at the assigned table to participate in games and quizzes. It was a lot of fun. Ambience is all classy with the bar and high chair along with couches. I loved the wall art on the gateway to the open air sitting area which is done with Gupi Bagha, Tana Rickshaw and all the nostalgic memoirs of Kolkata.

The food was equally good. There were many cocktails and I, being a teetotaler had the virgin versions of all the drinks. Some of them were great, actually. We had ‚Äì

Kerala Red Rice Salad - Baby spinach, red rice, raw mango, coconut, peanuts and upmensinkai (salted chilli from Karnataka). I generally do not eat chillies, but this one was so good. Loved it a lot.

Mac & Cheese Croquettes ‚Äì Golden fried broccoli and peas along with chilli mayo and salsa. I am a fan of cheese. So the croquettes were really admired.

Med Platter - Falafel, spinach, cheese filo parcels, hummus, smoked baba ganoush, roasted peppers, olives, with pita bread and labneh. The presentation of this platter was really an eye catching one. It was really good.

Smoked Beetroot and Beans Galouti - Melt in mouth vegetarian galouti on saffron laced taftan, onion and mint chutney. This dish too was okay.

Baked Brie ‚Äì Oh! I loved this dish. Brie cheese with filo surrounded by pineapple salsa. The cheese oozing out of the pastry created all the sensation. Loved this dish a lot. Had a huge share of it from my table.

Prawn Pil Pil - Tossed in olive oil with chilli, garlic and parsley. It was served with garlic rubbed toast. This was extremely delicious. Loved the dish a lot specially for its aroma and the garlic breads, specially.

Tikki of Joy - Kolkata inspired Bhetki fish cutlets with kasundi, fennel seed & coriander, served with mint chutney. This is one classic dish which no Calcuttan will ever fail to love. I was no exception.

Tiger Beef - Slices of steak tossed with chilli paste, black beans, galangal, ginger, bean sprouts, lemon, bok choy and peppers. This dish was a bit spicy, not suited to my taste but loved by my fellow foodies at the table.

Butterfly Chicken - Sweet, spicy, crispy bits of chicken tossed with sesame, chilli, honey and peppers; stuffed in our signature butterfly shells. The butterfly shells resembled to a savoury treat from the lands of Andhra Pradesh, popularly known as Phoolbu. This dish was unique, in presentation and taste.

Laal Maas Phulka Tacos ‚Äì Who doesn‚Äôt know about this classical delicacy of Rajasthan? Monkey Bar has successfully fused this Indian beauty along with Mexican Tacos. This twist in the cuisines creates the beauty of the culinary culture and here lies the skill of a chef, who is an artist in this case. Loved this dish for the innovation.

Spare Pork Ribs ‚Äì Trust me, it is the best pork dish I have had till date. The pork was so soft, juicy and tender that it literally melted inside the mouth. It was tossed in a tangy and sweet sauce which was really good. Writing the review after 5-6 days but I still can‚Äôt get over the beauty of the pork ribs.

Gondhoraj Lime Tart ‚Äì This was one unique dessert we have tried there. Lemon curd, torched meringue, lemon & mint gel, pistachio cake & cookie crust ‚Äì combination of all good things at one go. Loved the refreshing vibe of this dessert.

The Snicker Bar ‚Äì I am not a big Snicker fan. But this dessert along with the perfect swirls of the s‚Äômore has become one of the desserts to crave for at the strangest of times. Milk chocolate ganache, dark chocolate micro cake, hazelnut praline cream, salted caramel gel being the composition of this dessert, I loved it till the end.

Drinks ‚Äì Copper Monkey, Manga, Pack of Punch, Toast To Calcutta, Mad Men. I was in Team Copper Monkey. Had the virgin version of all the drinks. Liked the Manga to be the best, which they claim to be one of their signature cocktails along with Copper Monkey, which was also very good.

I would like to thank the nationally acclaimed figure Chef Manu Chandra to spend and share his valuable words about food and Team Monkey Bar for having us over and presenting a lifetime of memories. Best wishes to the team and may they prosper ahead. Happy Dining! :) |
 
Monkey Bar | The Hungry Desis (Ramya & Chiranjeev) | 30569103 | 4.5 | 2016-09-08 16:29:59 | Monkey Bar has finally come to the City of Joy and promises to be a perfect place to have fun and relax. When we walked into the gastropub, the first thing that came to our minds was "classy and quirky".¬†
The best of it all is the stunning view.  You have a clear sight of the St. Paul's Cathedral and the Victoria Memorial in the distance. The service staff are swift and attentive.
 Another thoughtful design is the assortment of condiments and cutlery set on the tables. You can use them as you like instead of calling for the servers everytime. The cocktails are innovative, using a variety of ingredients and the food is lip-smackingly delicious! Our recommendations are the Mangaa and the Tipsy Sherbet among the drinks. With regards to the food, the vegetarian dishes are as good as the non vegetarian ones. We suggest the Med Platter and the Baked Brie among the vegetarian choices. For the non-vegetarians, the Prawn Pil Pil is a must try. To achieve full satiisfaction, do sample the Snicker Bar..it is to die for! |
 
Monkey Bar | Varnika | 380228 | 4.5 | 2016-09-07 10:06:59 | The wait is finally over. The moment you enter Monkey Bar, you get the feel of the one in Bangalore. The open air area is simply amazing, the view of Victoria Memorial is breathtaking. 
I loved the ambience of the inner section as well. Even though it has some basic monkey bar elements missing the place is great overall. 
We ordered the MoBar Classic Chilli Cheese Dragons which were to die for. 
For drinks we had the Copper One which was quite bad. It didn't taste of Alcohol at all. 
Taste of Calcutta was refreshing and nice. Pack a punch was also decent. 
All in all once they start functioning full time and properly it will be a great place. Super excited! |
 
Monkey Bar | Roli Vajpeyi | 909801 | 5.0 | 2016-09-06 23:07:49 | Monkey bar finally opens in Kolkata! You guys are in for a treat the cocktails are so unique and nice you can't just order one! And the snacks are just awesome. This is my new hang out place. The desserts specially the snickers one is just amazing. |

Saldanha Bakery | Shaurya Pathak | 367302 | 4.0 | 2016-12-17 21:09:23 | It will be a time taking process to find this place. But it will test your resolve for the love of food.
Don't look around. Just look down and enjoy the lip smacking goodies. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Kashif Ahmed | 1115831 | 4.5 | 2016-12-14 19:10:28 | Surprisingly, this joint serves the best Walnut Cakes i have ever tasted in my life..... It is a very old bakery.... The patties is also lip smacking....
Strongly recommend the Walnut Cake, try it once....But kindly refrain from taking your vehicle as parking is a serious pain..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Amrita Mondal | 36255179 | 4.0 | 2016-10-28 21:36:46 | The best bakery in town for traditional Christmas goodies like fruit cake, walnut cake, plain butter cake, plum cake, Brownies, tarts, etc. It is a place where bulk orders are taken generally. It is not a shop or a cafe. It is a bakery where you order stuff and take away. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tuks4 | 36484659 | 4.5 | 2016-10-25 00:29:07 | ive been an indirect customer of this bakery for a while.. my sis's school orders their items regularly and i get to taste them too :)
this time though, i went to the place & had my own order.. a good number of chicken & corn envelope & choc truffle cake, both eggless & w/ egg..

my 1 line verdict.. the BEST bakery in the city.. period. in terms of taste + price + raw materials + the care + the old-school process, this is without doubt the best place in Calcutta.. & i repeat CALCUTTA and not kolkatta or kolkutta or some other rubbish misnaming this city gets !
this is the place that makes proper patties, proper macrones, cakes & pastries.. almost all of their items taste uniquely clean & refined.. and someone with a decent palette, will feel the 'non-commercial' taste as well..

i had a client team visiting from Poland who were extremely happy eating these items..¬† chicken envelope is their costliest item @35 a pc.. v filling yet flaky & light.. the choc truffle cake melted away inside the mouth.. super soft !
ul see amul butter being used to fry the onions.. pure almond crumbs being used inside the cake's base.. egg whites been beaten for 30mins until those nice soft peaks show up.. no wonder the taste is superlative !

few downsides to mention.. the cheese puff is not good at all.. slice cakes are sometimes stiff.. the place can do better without being that cluttery.. someone with a nose for hygiene might not be thrilled with all the 'hands' being used.. but i guess that too is their USP at some point :) |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anushka Agarwal | 34748091 | 3.5 | 2016-10-24 11:21:12 | Been to this joint lately and loved their brownies and cakes. They are freshly baked and delicious both at the same time. Usually if you go to this place during late evening you'll miss out on most of the stuffs. Pre-ordering recommended. ‚úåüèªÔ∏è |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Debadyuti Karan | 5018051 | 4.0 | 2016-08-30 22:52:05 | Kolkata is full of sweet surprises. Who would ever guess that an old yellow house in central Kolkata houses one of the best bakeries in town?! A cake lovers paradise, this bakery is famous for its weddings cakes for the Anglo Indians. Good things don't come easy; one needs to make an effort to relish their creations. A pre order is a must at this 80 year old bakery. While most of their stuff is good, the must must must on the order list would be their almond cake, coconut macaroons and their soft moist dark brownies. If you are lucky and drop by you might find some' bakes' of the day that you could pick up. Debra Saldanha one of the daughters now runs the place and maintains the high quality standard set by her parents. The place is not a fancy store. They know their quality is far better than most bakeries in town and they let their baking do the talking. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Rajtilak Bhattacharjee | 68484 | 5.0 | 2016-08-20 22:28:12 | The best bakery in Kolkata. Must try their almond cakes, macaroons, and chocolate fudges. You can pre-order, although there is no home delivery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Indrajit Lahiri | 542545 | 4.5 | 2016-08-02 16:47:16 | There goes around a story in Kolkata gastronomic circuit that the best traditional l anglo-Indian cakes are found not in fancy hotels, but in few homes, and over the period of time, they‚Äôve become legends. Many have heard of the name, but few have actually been there, the name‚Äôs Saldanha Bakery and Confectionary

One should reach Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road (the tram road) and find out the B C Sen Jewellery shop on it. While in the afternoon, the traffic moves towards north, it comes on the right hand side. Take the adjacent lane and after 50-100 mtrs, you can find a yellow house on your left with Saldanha written on the outside wall. Parking is a big big problem. Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tisyaketu Sirkar | 3479861 | 5.0 | 2016-07-14 13:57:20 | This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Sumit Surai | 11641 | 4.0 | 2016-07-13 22:52:39 | This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Arjun Kumar Roy | 33434945 | 5.0 | 2016-05-18 00:48:34 | Its an amazing bakery where we get great some authentic baked products. Please try their cakes, mousses and other stuff... Its one the oldest in our city and serves you upto your expectations... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anwesha Ghosh | 14295941 | 3.5 | 2016-02-12 19:26:47 | One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Jude Martin | 1895578 | 4.0 | 2016-01-26 23:48:16 | Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Suhail Hassan | 684685 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 15:28:43 | Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items**** |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Koushik Paul | 16411585 | 4.5 | 2016-01-09 10:10:47 | What to say about this!! It is actually a hidden gem! One of my friend suggested this for Christmas cake shopping. It made us tired to find it out but cakes are actually superb!!! |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Oindrila Paul | 16152668 | 5.0 | 2016-01-08 00:38:34 | I will give 5 stars to this bakery because I've eaten here many a times and if has never let me down. Right from it's vegetarian items to the non vegetarian ones, and from the pastries to the cakes, Saldanha is pure bliss |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Madhurya Chaudhuri | 30816267 | 4.5 | 2016-01-06 21:09:10 | Awesome cakes,brownies,lemon drops and chicken patties . British cakes are the best. Assorted chocolates are good too. And everything comes in a very reasonable price. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Swarnendu Chandra | 32142557 | 5.0 | 2016-01-02 14:06:38 | I visited this place after reading a report in a local newspaper, and experience was mesmerizing. The walnut cake and fruit cake was simply delicious. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Souvik Sen | 9493051 | 4.5 | 2015-12-29 16:56:20 | Great Cakes I must say...This year I had their walnut & chocolate cakes in Christmas...Both was fabulous...Walnut was better...Price was INR 220/- per cake but considering the quality it really worth it..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Apple Orange | 31197595 | 5.0 | 2015-12-25 17:26:35 | I have never been to the shop but in our office every year during Christmas we get cakes from Saldanah Bakery and it is never enough...The Christmas cakes are simply what a first class cake should be...soft ...fresh and...the level sweetness is just right..love it every year and now it's  a ritual...will be visiting soon..üòäüòäüòä |

Saldanha Bakery | Tuks4 | 36484659 | 4.5 | 2016-10-25 00:29:07 | ive been an indirect customer of this bakery for a while.. my sis's school orders their items regularly and i get to taste them too :)
this time though, i went to the place & had my own order.. a good number of chicken & corn envelope & choc truffle cake, both eggless & w/ egg..

my 1 line verdict.. the BEST bakery in the city.. period. in terms of taste + price + raw materials + the care + the old-school process, this is without doubt the best place in Calcutta.. & i repeat CALCUTTA and not kolkatta or kolkutta or some other rubbish misnaming this city gets !
this is the place that makes proper patties, proper macrones, cakes & pastries.. almost all of their items taste uniquely clean & refined.. and someone with a decent palette, will feel the 'non-commercial' taste as well..

i had a client team visiting from Poland who were extremely happy eating these items..¬† chicken envelope is their costliest item @35 a pc.. v filling yet flaky & light.. the choc truffle cake melted away inside the mouth.. super soft !
ul see amul butter being used to fry the onions.. pure almond crumbs being used inside the cake's base.. egg whites been beaten for 30mins until those nice soft peaks show up.. no wonder the taste is superlative !

few downsides to mention.. the cheese puff is not good at all.. slice cakes are sometimes stiff.. the place can do better without being that cluttery.. someone with a nose for hygiene might not be thrilled with all the 'hands' being used.. but i guess that too is their USP at some point :) |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anushka Agarwal | 34748091 | 3.5 | 2016-10-24 11:21:12 | Been to this joint lately and loved their brownies and cakes. They are freshly baked and delicious both at the same time. Usually if you go to this place during late evening you'll miss out on most of the stuffs. Pre-ordering recommended. ‚úåüèªÔ∏è |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Debadyuti Karan | 5018051 | 4.0 | 2016-08-30 22:52:05 | Kolkata is full of sweet surprises. Who would ever guess that an old yellow house in central Kolkata houses one of the best bakeries in town?! A cake lovers paradise, this bakery is famous for its weddings cakes for the Anglo Indians. Good things don't come easy; one needs to make an effort to relish their creations. A pre order is a must at this 80 year old bakery. While most of their stuff is good, the must must must on the order list would be their almond cake, coconut macaroons and their soft moist dark brownies. If you are lucky and drop by you might find some' bakes' of the day that you could pick up. Debra Saldanha one of the daughters now runs the place and maintains the high quality standard set by her parents. The place is not a fancy store. They know their quality is far better than most bakeries in town and they let their baking do the talking. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Rajtilak Bhattacharjee | 68484 | 5.0 | 2016-08-20 22:28:12 | The best bakery in Kolkata. Must try their almond cakes, macaroons, and chocolate fudges. You can pre-order, although there is no home delivery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Indrajit Lahiri | 542545 | 4.5 | 2016-08-02 16:47:16 | There goes around a story in Kolkata gastronomic circuit that the best traditional l anglo-Indian cakes are found not in fancy hotels, but in few homes, and over the period of time, they‚Äôve become legends. Many have heard of the name, but few have actually been there, the name‚Äôs Saldanha Bakery and Confectionary

One should reach Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road (the tram road) and find out the B C Sen Jewellery shop on it. While in the afternoon, the traffic moves towards north, it comes on the right hand side. Take the adjacent lane and after 50-100 mtrs, you can find a yellow house on your left with Saldanha written on the outside wall. Parking is a big big problem. Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tisyaketu Sirkar | 3479861 | 5.0 | 2016-07-14 13:57:20 | This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Sumit Surai | 11641 | 4.0 | 2016-07-13 22:52:39 | This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Arjun Kumar Roy | 33434945 | 5.0 | 2016-05-18 00:48:34 | Its an amazing bakery where we get great some authentic baked products. Please try their cakes, mousses and other stuff... Its one the oldest in our city and serves you upto your expectations... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anwesha Ghosh | 14295941 | 3.5 | 2016-02-12 19:26:47 | One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Jude Martin | 1895578 | 4.0 | 2016-01-26 23:48:16 | Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Suhail Hassan | 684685 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 15:28:43 | Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items**** |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Koushik Paul | 16411585 | 4.5 | 2016-01-09 10:10:47 | What to say about this!! It is actually a hidden gem! One of my friend suggested this for Christmas cake shopping. It made us tired to find it out but cakes are actually superb!!! |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Oindrila Paul | 16152668 | 5.0 | 2016-01-08 00:38:34 | I will give 5 stars to this bakery because I've eaten here many a times and if has never let me down. Right from it's vegetarian items to the non vegetarian ones, and from the pastries to the cakes, Saldanha is pure bliss |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Madhurya Chaudhuri | 30816267 | 4.5 | 2016-01-06 21:09:10 | Awesome cakes,brownies,lemon drops and chicken patties . British cakes are the best. Assorted chocolates are good too. And everything comes in a very reasonable price. |

Saldanha Bakery | Apple Orange | 31197595 | 5.0 | 2015-12-25 17:26:35 | I have never been to the shop but in our office every year during Christmas we get cakes from Saldanah Bakery and it is never enough...The Christmas cakes are simply what a first class cake should be...soft ...fresh and...the level sweetness is just right..love it every year and now it's  a ritual...will be visiting soon..üòäüòäüòä |

few downsides to mention.. the cheese puff is not good at all.. slice cakes are sometimes stiff.. the place can do better without being that cluttery.. someone with a nose for hygiene might not be thrilled with all the 'hands' being used.. but i guess that too is their USP at some point :) |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anushka Agarwal | 34748091 | 3.5 | 2016-10-24 11:21:12 | Been to this joint lately and loved their brownies and cakes. They are freshly baked and delicious both at the same time. Usually if you go to this place during late evening you'll miss out on most of the stuffs. Pre-ordering recommended. ‚úåüèªÔ∏è |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Debadyuti Karan | 5018051 | 4.0 | 2016-08-30 22:52:05 | Kolkata is full of sweet surprises. Who would ever guess that an old yellow house in central Kolkata houses one of the best bakeries in town?! A cake lovers paradise, this bakery is famous for its weddings cakes for the Anglo Indians. Good things don't come easy; one needs to make an effort to relish their creations. A pre order is a must at this 80 year old bakery. While most of their stuff is good, the must must must on the order list would be their almond cake, coconut macaroons and their soft moist dark brownies. If you are lucky and drop by you might find some' bakes' of the day that you could pick up. Debra Saldanha one of the daughters now runs the place and maintains the high quality standard set by her parents. The place is not a fancy store. They know their quality is far better than most bakeries in town and they let their baking do the talking. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Rajtilak Bhattacharjee | 68484 | 5.0 | 2016-08-20 22:28:12 | The best bakery in Kolkata. Must try their almond cakes, macaroons, and chocolate fudges. You can pre-order, although there is no home delivery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Indrajit Lahiri | 542545 | 4.5 | 2016-08-02 16:47:16 | There goes around a story in Kolkata gastronomic circuit that the best traditional l anglo-Indian cakes are found not in fancy hotels, but in few homes, and over the period of time, they‚Äôve become legends. Many have heard of the name, but few have actually been there, the name‚Äôs Saldanha Bakery and Confectionary

One should reach Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road (the tram road) and find out the B C Sen Jewellery shop on it. While in the afternoon, the traffic moves towards north, it comes on the right hand side. Take the adjacent lane and after 50-100 mtrs, you can find a yellow house on your left with Saldanha written on the outside wall. Parking is a big big problem. Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tisyaketu Sirkar | 3479861 | 5.0 | 2016-07-14 13:57:20 | This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Sumit Surai | 11641 | 4.0 | 2016-07-13 22:52:39 | This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Arjun Kumar Roy | 33434945 | 5.0 | 2016-05-18 00:48:34 | Its an amazing bakery where we get great some authentic baked products. Please try their cakes, mousses and other stuff... Its one the oldest in our city and serves you upto your expectations... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anwesha Ghosh | 14295941 | 3.5 | 2016-02-12 19:26:47 | One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Jude Martin | 1895578 | 4.0 | 2016-01-26 23:48:16 | Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Suhail Hassan | 684685 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 15:28:43 | Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items**** |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Koushik Paul | 16411585 | 4.5 | 2016-01-09 10:10:47 | What to say about this!! It is actually a hidden gem! One of my friend suggested this for Christmas cake shopping. It made us tired to find it out but cakes are actually superb!!! |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Oindrila Paul | 16152668 | 5.0 | 2016-01-08 00:38:34 | I will give 5 stars to this bakery because I've eaten here many a times and if has never let me down. Right from it's vegetarian items to the non vegetarian ones, and from the pastries to the cakes, Saldanha is pure bliss |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Madhurya Chaudhuri | 30816267 | 4.5 | 2016-01-06 21:09:10 | Awesome cakes,brownies,lemon drops and chicken patties . British cakes are the best. Assorted chocolates are good too. And everything comes in a very reasonable price. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Swarnendu Chandra | 32142557 | 5.0 | 2016-01-02 14:06:38 | I visited this place after reading a report in a local newspaper, and experience was mesmerizing. The walnut cake and fruit cake was simply delicious. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Souvik Sen | 9493051 | 4.5 | 2015-12-29 16:56:20 | Great Cakes I must say...This year I had their walnut & chocolate cakes in Christmas...Both was fabulous...Walnut was better...Price was INR 220/- per cake but considering the quality it really worth it..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Apple Orange | 31197595 | 5.0 | 2015-12-25 17:26:35 | I have never been to the shop but in our office every year during Christmas we get cakes from Saldanah Bakery and it is never enough...The Christmas cakes are simply what a first class cake should be...soft ...fresh and...the level sweetness is just right..love it every year and now it's  a ritual...will be visiting soon..üòäüòäüòä |

Saldanha Bakery | Shaurya Pathak | 367302 | 4.0 | 2016-12-17 21:09:23 | It will be a time taking process to find this place. But it will test your resolve for the love of food.
Don't look around. Just look down and enjoy the lip smacking goodies. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Kashif Ahmed | 1115831 | 4.5 | 2016-12-14 19:10:28 | Surprisingly, this joint serves the best Walnut Cakes i have ever tasted in my life..... It is a very old bakery.... The patties is also lip smacking....
Strongly recommend the Walnut Cake, try it once....But kindly refrain from taking your vehicle as parking is a serious pain..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Amrita Mondal | 36255179 | 4.0 | 2016-10-28 21:36:46 | The best bakery in town for traditional Christmas goodies like fruit cake, walnut cake, plain butter cake, plum cake, Brownies, tarts, etc. It is a place where bulk orders are taken generally. It is not a shop or a cafe. It is a bakery where you order stuff and take away. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tuks4 | 36484659 | 4.5 | 2016-10-25 00:29:07 | ive been an indirect customer of this bakery for a while.. my sis's school orders their items regularly and i get to taste them too :)
this time though, i went to the place & had my own order.. a good number of chicken & corn envelope & choc truffle cake, both eggless & w/ egg..

my 1 line verdict.. the BEST bakery in the city.. period. in terms of taste + price + raw materials + the care + the old-school process, this is without doubt the best place in Calcutta.. & i repeat CALCUTTA and not kolkatta or kolkutta or some other rubbish misnaming this city gets !
this is the place that makes proper patties, proper macrones, cakes & pastries.. almost all of their items taste uniquely clean & refined.. and someone with a decent palette, will feel the 'non-commercial' taste as well..

i had a client team visiting from Poland who were extremely happy eating these items..¬† chicken envelope is their costliest item @35 a pc.. v filling yet flaky & light.. the choc truffle cake melted away inside the mouth.. super soft !

Monkey Bar | Sirsha Dhar | 2015246 | 4.5 | 2016-12-15 21:54:11 | My friend, who was leaving the city soon wanted to go out for food and drinks and what could have been better than our decision to hit the Monkey Bar. Finally opened in Kolkata, one of the best-located bar there possibly is. On the 9th floor of Fort Knox on Camac Street, this looks down the beautiful Kolkata skyline with the 2nd bridge, Victoria, St. Pauls church and what not. The place is huge, quaintly decorated with the essential Bong touch both in the menu and the bar. Has an open area with a huge screen. 
For food we ordered the Mobar Caramelised Pork Ribs. Melt in the mouth pork meat. Smoked Chicken, Chicken Salami and Harissa pizza. For drinks we took the Beamer LIIT. Just the right punch of alcohol and tang! Lovely experience. Would definitely like to go back again. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohan Belani | 3081061 | 3.5 | 2016-12-15 02:58:39 | The place has a chill vibe . Went with a few school buddies.  There is a open air section as well as an indoor section where you can sit and chill . Drinks were nice . Service could be better . The staff were not attentive enough . Lastly the music . There were people singing karaoke. I mean it's cool to sing and all but we expected some chill music with the setting . |
 
Monkey Bar | Pratik Shah | 31614924 | 3.0 | 2016-12-14 13:50:20 | With an indoor and outdoor seating options and great ambience "monkey bar" is sure to impress you . I didnt order much to eat , bt watever i ordered was average - 
Yes it is lil on the expensive side - overall good place to chill once in a while . |
 
Monkey Bar | Shruti Bhaiya | 593379 | 4.0 | 2016-12-11 17:47:13 | A must go places for the party peeps in kolkata.  Good food , good music and an awesome ambience. .  A complete thumbs up .. the only thumbs down would be the quantity  of the food served , it's too little and gives u just a taste of the dish !! |
 
Monkey Bar | Avinaba Das Sarkar | 409341 | 3.0 | 2016-12-11 11:02:59 | Went yesterday with a business partner, wasn't really very particular about a place but since it was located near by thought of visiting it once. Few observations

1. The ambiance is nice and the interiors are pretty well done.

2. Music is pretty loud and if you are intending to have a prolonged conversation with someone it would be difficult. 

3. The biggest drawback is the food, we ordered two veg starters since my friend was veg. The quantity and the taste wasn't something justifying the price or the brand. The food was OK but it isn't something one will find difficult to prepare in there kitchen. 

Overall experience was okay since we primarily went there to seat and talk. But comparing the same with the likes to cafe mezzuna or the grid would make this place average at the best. Hope the management looks into it. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rishi Agarwal | 1632482 | 4.5 | 2016-12-10 17:02:43 | On the 9th floor at Fort Knox, the newly opened Monkey Bar is a beautiful place to visit. The place offers an unmatched view of the city and the interiors and a class apart which make it one step ahead of other places in the city.
The food on offer is delicious. The mushrooms I ordered and the chilli cheese dragons are a must try for all.
Overall a great new place to visit with a great atmosphere and very polite attendants. |
 
Monkey Bar | TraveKings | 29893242 | 4.5 | 2016-12-07 13:14:55 | Located at Fort Knox. It is like Social in Delhi. Good Ambience. Maintaining a Good Standard. Decent Crowd. Decent Hookah & Decent Food. Good Service.¬†2 big screen to enjoy live sports .¬†Little expensive. It will cost around Rs.3000 for 2 person.A Good place to hangout with friends. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sukanya Ghosh | 589490 | 3.5 | 2016-12-04 21:24:11 | This one is new in Kolkata, and is definitely pulling lot of crowd. I went there on a Friday evening with two of my friends and it was full of people. Located in camac street, near Urban Desi, not too difficult to locate. The moment you step in , the first thing you notice are the big french windows with a view to die for :), Howrah Bridge and Victoria Memorial at the same, who would not love that!¬†
Now coming to the food, its nothing extraordinary, very mediocre tasting with prices on the higher side. We ordered for 1 mix mushroom bruschetta, mushroom and truffle oil pizza, and tikki of joy (fish). The bruschetta and the pizza was very ordinary, bland in taste I would say. Tikki of joy was definitely good with very subtle flavours, perfectly cooked to perfection.
My rating is truly for the ambience and the fish, anyway one could always try out this place¬†
Thumbs up for the view :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Gunjan Saraf | 33964908 | 4.5 | 2016-12-03 14:49:16 | My visit to this place raised my bar of expectations from kolkatas nightlife.. Posh crowd, sophisticated ambience, soothing music, projector screen for matches, good food and superb hukka! The place has it all. We ordered for lebanese platter and cheese spring rolls, both finger licking good! The capuccino cofee was average but the hukka made up for it! A must visit for all the crazy kolkatans looking for a break from chai break! |
 
Monkey Bar | Subham Agarwal | 777244 | 1.0 | 2016-12-01 13:05:10 | THIS PLACE IS PATHETIC

I ATE THE PANEER KHICHDI AND I AND MY FRIEND BOTH ¬†HAD A TERRIBLE INFECTION AFTER HAVING THIS. I THINK THEIR COOKING STANDARDS ARE VERY LOW.

WHEN I CALLED THEM TO SAY THAT I HAD A TERRIBLE INFECTION AFTER HAVING YOUR FOOD THEY ¬†HAD NO ANSWER.

I HAVE ALSO PUT UP A COMPLAIN AT FOOD AND QUALITY STANDARDS DEPARTMENT AGAINST THEM,

I SUGGEST NO ONE SHOULD GO THERE AT ALL. |
 
Monkey Bar | Risshe Malhotra | 31063007 | 4.5 | 2016-11-29 22:39:12 | Amazing food lovely ambience, joy is one of the best ppl he makes you feel special and the service is out of the world. Centrally located... |

Monkey Bar | Kirti Agarwal | 16014301 | 3.0 | 2016-11-28 15:30:12 | I think it is one of the over rated places..the service was ok..music was very sad n sheesha not dat great...although ambience was good..but such a brand it is..der is an expectation bar which it disappoints to a great extent. |
 
Monkey Bar | Amrita Ghosh | 33949647 | 4.0 | 2016-11-26 20:51:37 | Want to dine with a view of Victoria memorial, step in here, which interiors n amazing food, gud classics as music and a lovely crowd, one cn spend hours here dining n wining. Food: chicken nachos is a good quantity. Mediterranean platter a lovly combo of flavors n great taste. Pizzas are thin crust n perfect. Drinks are innovative, I tried mamas girl & mojitos. Its one a litl higher side on the pocket but not exorbitant. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sanjiv Sood | 186102 | 4.5 | 2016-11-26 07:39:01 | The ‚ÄòMonkey Bar‚Äô Kolkata Avatar is a welcome addition to it's watering hole map and what an experience it metes out! Located in the heart of the city (Camac Street) with a huge and lofty space, it exudes a comfort zone feel. The visual delight of the interior space couples well with a spectacular view of the Kolkata skyline from the restaurant.¬†

The cream de la cr√®me among the restaurant‚Äôs USP's is the outdoor seating arrangement of about 5-6 tables. Although open to air, yet it is air-conditioned to beat the muggier months. Incidentally during the clement months it would be a pronounced experience to soak in Kolkata‚Äôs mild winters. The corner verandah serves hookah for the y-generation and for those who love to smoke with their tipple it is a rather comfortable space. I loved the incipient November chill all through the evening in the outdoor! It would be an idyllic place all through the wintery months to soak in the chilled weather.

Though I am not a cocktail loving person, I ventured out to try some of their swinging concoctions. First shot was the famed Manga.

Sweet and Tangy Vodka based cocktail, it had an all desi flavour burst from the Aam Panna as the main base with its signature cumin flavour to follow. It comes in a kullar shaped glass with etched in a typical Hinglish font that sets the tone for a fusion evening. 
Next, was the more stylized ‚ÄòMad Men‚Äô a Bourbon base with Coffee Orange and a whiff of Rosemary spray, which, I really liked and got myself a double dose.

 
 

Getting headier, I tried out the Copper Monkey, lo and behold but predictably it was in a copper mug. I quite liked the passion fruit flavour and the hint of mint in it worked well.

¬†

Although christened as ‚ÄòMonkey Bar‚Äô one would be rather surprised to see a super array of fusion food alongwith some very innovative desi leaning twisters. One look at the menu and I was instantly attracted to the Laal Maas Phulka Tacos, Radish cake bites for its novelty, Mobar Caramelized Pork ribs for its slow cooking and the Butterfly Chicken for the signature shells. 
The Laal Maas in the Phulka Tacos was juicy and well done, served on a ¬†Bao Stand for appeal as well as to function as a 'hold on'.  The meat was unique in flavour and spiced up enough to support its Laal Maas Status! 

 

The radish /mooli cake bites were indeed a experience though one really cannot make out if radish is used as the main filling ingredient unless told. The Tempura batter and the black bean sauce make up for the frunchy bite and flavour of the Radish bites.

 

The caramelized rib was succulent and smokey, living up the 6-hour slow cooked traditional method. So was it's house sauce quite zesty and lip smacking. 

 

The Butterfly Chicken was perhaps the only dish, which I would give the pass, though a visual delight again. I was lead to believe or was expecting a Butter Chicken filling. Maybe that is a good idea too.

Overall this place is not all just ambience, though that feeling is certainly overwhelming and sets up the mood. The service, food and the liquid chemistry in the cocktails are commendable too.

Monkey Bar | Kaustav Nayak | 1276373 | 5.0 | 2016-11-25 09:43:48 | With its French windows giving a glimpse of both the Victoria Memorial as well as the Howrah Bridge, the ambient lighting, great music, brick walls, a gorgeous skylight, a section that projects black and white motion picture and an apparently messy but ultimately symmetric seating arrangement that will please the OCD in you, Monkey Bar is hands down the best looking place in town. The ambiance, crowd and the location itself (9th floor of the Fort Knox building in Camac Street) itself demands a high rating. But it outdoes itself in the food department as well.¬†

The tiger beef is an instant classic. Perfectly cooked and just the right amount oily, this is a dish that I will highly recommend. The chettinad chicken samosas on the other hand flattered to deceive, definitely not worth the high price. Reddy's chicken popcorn though is a whole different story : small pieces of chicken fried with curry leaves, ¬†sesame, coconut shreds and a concoction of south Indian spices.¬†The name that will pique your interest however is the butter chicken khichudi. Bengali style sticky rice cooked amalgamated with Punjabi style chicken butter masala, this is a dish that has sharp flavors very well attuned for the Indian tongue. I absolutely loved it! 4 small cups containing curd, ghee, pickle and papad are given as accompaniments.¬†
¬†

And just everything else, their dessert section is more than competent too. While the snicker bar with its milk chocolate ganache on a crunchy almond base and a chocolate cake below may feel a tad too sweet, they provide a coffee ice cream to go with it and together the balance is delectable. The gondhoraj lime tart was more in my wheelhouse : the tangy lime curd really stood out. If I have to recommend one among these two I'd say take a leap of faith, ditch the always reliable chocolate and go for the tart.¬†

Here's to next time. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pratik Sensarma | 10848301 | 5.0 | 2016-11-22 20:50:17 | A too good place to b with your friends...had been there some days before...services are good...and ambience... Wat a place... After a long time had been to such an awesome place like this... One could have a marvelous view of the city Kolkata... Specially our Victoria memorial and cathedral Church...the foods are very tasty ...starting from Manga , tiger beef, tikki of joye to other cocktails  everything was perfectly made and served. Then lastly the desserts...the chocolate cake mainly... Was the best... Really had an too good time..keep it up guys  :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Anusreea Paul | 2257306 | 4.5 | 2016-11-21 12:13:39 | The famous brand is finally here in Kolkata. It's been three months since they opened doors on Camac Street and there's been no looking back for them :)
Had the opportunity to visit the place thanks to a bloggers meet. This is the brain child of chef Manu Chandra, the team, the food is crafted by him. The place epitomizes awesomeness in every inch. The place is big, read huge!! The huge old school windows lead you to stare at the city landscape with wide open eyes. They have an open seating arena, high rise chairs and comfortable sofas to choose from. They serve alcohol and hookah. They even arrange for sundowners on wintry afternoons, for you to sip on their lavish cocktails and enjoy the sun going down. The Victoria Memorial and the Howrah bridge are visual delights. They have their pub rules hence it is better to read them up and visit!
The crafted menu for the afternoon:

**Drinks**

Copper Monkey: Served in a copper vessel with a ¬†chunk of orange came this cocktail, whiskey based.

Manga: The ever famous drink, vodka based, a concoct of vodka and mango pulp.

Hipster Smash: Smacking name, and a refreshing drink! The array of colors are incredible. Mix of watermelon juice, a huge chunk of frozen watermelon and vodka.

Old Fashioned on Camac: The name might sound synonymous with rum but it is a whiskey based cocktail.

**Food**

Kerala Red Rice: A vegetarian and a non-vegetarians' delight! Thick red rice mixed with southern spices. It's spicy, it's crunchy, and it's tangy!!

Tiger Beef: The best, best, best beef is served here!! A bowlful of spicy meaty delight!! The shredded, well cooked, perfectly spiced beef served as the best chakna with the cocktails. Quite filling, good in quantity. Must order and highly recommended.

Butterfly Chicken: The outer coatings are designed like butterflies. Fried to perfection, oil less, the butterfly winged shaped cups are visual delights. Filled inside the cups are shredded chicken mixed in a nice sauce. Recommended for the sheer taste, intensity of the dish, and the efforts behind the perfect butterfly wings!

Shammi Sliders: These little burgers are lovely to look at. They do not fill you up completely yet leave you quite satisfied. The minced meat patties are perfect and there's no saucy drips. You actually do not mess yourself up eating this. Accompanied with some house special fries served inside a cute monkey bar wrapper.

Tikki of Joy: Quite a big hit down south, they decided to include it in their Kolkata menu as well. Huge chunks of bhetki frie to perfection. Served with onion rings and mint chutney. Crispy, ample fish in every mouthful, not oily at all.

Lal Maas Phulka Tacos: even sized parathas half rolled like rolls, filled with minced juicy meat. The meat is tender and you would feel like you are eating a roll, Kolkata style!!

**Desserts**

Gondhoraj Lime Tart: Tad a bit too bitter if eaten without the entire chunk. The idea is take a bit of the biscuit base, the creme, the lemon curd, the pistachio cake, and the raspberry sugared petals. And you could keep eating that and stare into the dreamy wintry sky line. But make sure to get a window seat..:)

Old Monkey Signature Chocolate Cake: What is a chocolate if it does not make you high!!! Well, this one sure does...a huge chunk of chocolate bar sprinkled with praline and caramel sauce. Served with a little scoop of ice cream...aaahhh never felt better!!¬†

Guys, agar aap Monkey Bar nahi gaye to please jaldi jaiye...it's waiting for you!! The coolest place in town to rock and roll. Try their karaoke nights or their usual dining hours, you will not be disappointing!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Suruchi Bhawsinghka | 1140387 | 3.0 | 2016-11-21 09:59:22 | The amount of tax,service charge vat, and wat not they are adding is insane.I have been to so many resto ,trust me this place is not worth it.I would rather sit in a five-star hotel lounge to spend around 5k between 4 ppl. If you leave aside the taxes you would always want to visit this place .Loved d simple decor(specially the huge windows ) perfect place to chill with friends and enjoy your drink.Snacks are average .Guys pls check ur taxes ...u r being unreasonable !!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Prarthana Roy | 1683183 | 3.5 | 2016-11-20 21:42:56 | Firstly , very much overpriced ! But fell in love with their decor and view .. food is overpriced according to their portion and most importantly they don't taste sound to be priced that much ! And coming to tax .. 1000 bucks ?! U will surely be left with a whole in ur pocket .. recommended for once , strictly ! |

Monkey Bar | Dhawal Pratap SIngh | 442772 | 3.5 | 2016-11-14 14:34:01 | The place has excellent ambience and definitely scores well on the food quality. However, the portions are really small adding on to the already heavy cost. Instead of 1500 for 2, its a place where you will incur Rs1500 per person. Plus the taxes are a lot on the pocket. Our regular bill of Rs 4800 had Rs2000 worth of taxes amounting to a total of Rs 6800! Paying 40% tax on top of my bill is not something I was looking forward to. |
 
Monkey Bar | Supriya Baid | 34842096 | 5.0 | 2016-11-13 20:55:15 | One of the best ambience i have ever seem in kolkata! Fabulous üëå great crowd. Good servers. Well maintained. Lovely presentation of food. Hookah love üíï keep it up guys ‚úå |
 
Monkey Bar | Shruti Keshri | 12428511 | 1.0 | 2016-11-08 22:26:50 | Pathetic place, the food quantity is so less, waiters don't understand anything, once you order the order only comes when you die hungry. We waited for  bill for almost 14 mins and then left, the waiter came running out to get the bill, and top of that the bill was wrong, they charged us for we didn't order also.

Over priced, lazy, pathetic place. Never visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | The Calcutta Foodie | 36569739 | 4.5 | 2016-11-08 11:14:50 | Monkey bar is the newest attraction in town and rightly so, talking about interiors the biggest hit is the huge Windows showing the skyline of Calcutta, it's a breathtaking view from the 9th floor. 

The menu is quite innovative and the concoctions in terms of the cocktails are pretty darn good.

The food doesn't disappoint at all the butterfly chicken was crispy and juicy which is very rare a combination and the pork ribs had a smokey barbecue flavour to them and were very, very soft. 

The place is slightly expensive, but, with that ambience and quality, it's hardly an issue. |
 
Monkey Bar | Ms_WalkingShoes | 1193155 | 4.5 | 2016-11-07 18:24:29 | Read d reviews on Zomato n planned to pop over to dis place.
The interiors..ambience...music..crowd n d staff is absolutely perfect.
The view is jus mindblowing n d breeze is so soothing.
We ordered Prawn Pil Pil which was yum..
The Beef Pickle and the Pork Sausages were a bit disappointing.
We had two beers and a virgin mojito.
D thing dat was bit disappointing was dat our bill was 2368Rs...out of which 535Rs was jus all kinda tax.
Overall this place is one of d best plc to hangout around. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rishav Dey | 193398 | 4.0 | 2016-11-07 14:01:53 | Six of us landed up at Monkey Bar on a Saturday evening. It was a nightlife hotspot at 19:30 hours already and we had to wait almost 40 minutes before we could be seated. We were ushered in and given the offer of crowding around the bar which we accepted.
The ambiance was great. Music was good and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Making a conversation wasn't the easiest thing to do but at places like this that is quite expected. 
We kicked off the evening with a portion of Loaded Nachos, 4 helpings of Pack a Punch, one Old Fashioned on Camac with bourbon and one Mama's Girl with Absolut. The last two we had to settle for because Toast to Calcutta couldn't me made due to lack of availability of gin. The nachos were appetizing and I liked my old fashioned with bourbon but the accompanying almond biscotti was too sweet for me. The pack a punch was good but the Mama's Girl was not appreciated by any one.
The Aam Admi Eggs went down well with me. It reminded me of the bhel puri walas and their chutneys. The eggs were soft but firm. It made me crave a bit for the soft, gooey and runny yolk. The Hispter Smash was nice but the Tipsy Sherbet was quite interesting for me because I have always wondered how alcohol would blend with rose syrup and Mo Bar did a wonderful job. The Copper Monkey was a bit like a fruity mint julep but I did like it. The Not so Vanilla was not quite my kind of cocktail with the creamy texture so I exchanged that for the Hipster Smash with a friend. The best cocktail according to me was by far the Mad Men. All the flavours combined really well and complimented each other beautifully. Coffee and orange always work well but the subtle rosemary was a delightful addition. 
The duck pita pockets were great. Oriental flavours in between a pita was an unusual combination but the pita seemed to go quite well with the duck in five spice and the hoisin sauce. The Kerala Beef Fry was nice but I would have loved to have it with Malabar parotta instead of the bread they served. The smoked chicken pizza was decent too. 
The service was very good. There was a period in between when we were very unhappy with the excruciatingly slow service but our server was extremely apologetic about it and cited the reason of a busy weekend evening for the barmen. It was understandable as far as I was concerned. The value for money is perhaps a bit on the lower side and I would say Mo Bar is a moderately expensive place. The food was mostly good. The drinks too were mostly very good. And I couldn't get enough of the Mad Men. So I will return for the Mad Men and to try the beef bulgogi, tiger beef, Goan chrizo pav, baked brie and prawn ghee roast. Recommended if one doesn't mind spending a bit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sharan Bansal | 394157 | 5.0 | 2016-11-06 18:14:14 | Amazing new York style ambience in Kolkata. Great hospitality and service! We had an awesome Sunday lunch with friends over champagne , rum punch and beer ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sahil Islam | 1001945 | 5.0 | 2016-11-05 00:53:16 | Lovely place with nice decor ...... The pricing was excellent given the quality of the food even for non drinkers it is a not to be missed spot loved the duck pita pocket and snicker bar |
 
Monkey Bar | Harsh Agarwal | 615445 | 4.5 | 2016-11-03 22:40:49 | Food, decor and ambience is top notch. Kolkata has got a Gem restaurant and bar. The view and seating is made for each other.

For the egg lovers-"Aam aadmi eggs. Sheer brilliant dish. Must try if you visit.

The staff needs to be a little polite and polished. Lack hospitality and softness. If they can improve upon this, it will be no doubt the finest joint in the city.

Will surely visit again. |
 
Monkey Bar | Santanu Adhikary | 31601287 | 4.5 | 2016-11-02 15:01:09 | Awesome ambience. ..mesmerising view of our beloved quintessential kolkata. ..love the taste of butterfly chicken and nachos with whisky. .. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul | 20537314 | 4.0 | 2016-10-31 13:45:15 | Great food, smooth shisha and pleasant staff at a great location. The food served was fresh and tasty. Though the open area for shisha is a little congested. This is a perfect alternative to bar exchange since the staff is very pleasant. Had an outing with 8 of team mates on October 25, costed 7.5 k excluding alcohol. Will be my preferred location for after work outings as long as the staff is pleasant. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pooja Marwaha | 1981882 | 4.0 | 2016-10-30 23:11:30 | One of the new places opened in Calcutta. This place has a great view of the city with good music. When I say good music, I mean music in the background and you can hear the person sitting opposite to you. The service is spot on. The servers attend to you first and do not chit chat in a corner. Now the food, ordered a farmers pizza which was good enough for an evening snack. The best thing that happened during the evening was the hookah. It was so smooth yet gave the kick. After a very long had really good hookah. The price pinch is moderate too. Would definitely visit more often now. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Agrawal | 1902980 | 4.5 | 2016-10-30 00:43:02 | Since its opening, have been there couple of times already. The evening view of the city is definitely one of the the ups of the place.¬†
The ambience is awesome and the right kind of classy touch interiors makes you want to come n relax with friends.¬†
The mocktails were good, and some dishes mentioning special mention are Chilli Cheese dragons, Med platter, Falafel Sliders and Mobar Laksa.¬†
Thanks Avantika for bringing the Monkey to town. :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Divya Khettry | 1930204 | 4.0 | 2016-10-29 12:09:30 | Finally the Monkey swings East! Must day amazing ambience and view. Drinks were great too the only thing I didn't like here was the food its a little average. I also loved the music all my fav tracks were played. |
 
Monkey Bar | Tushar Goyal | 1881622 | 4.5 | 2016-10-29 10:47:35 | Unluckily I ended up to the place on a Thursday and it was a dry day there, but the food was phenomenal . The moment you see the menu you want to try everything .

We ordered loaded nacho was very good , beet and orange salad which was ok , kimchi baby potatoes is a must try.
For the mains I ordered paneer kichdi which was good and the soulful bowl chilly paneer was good too. 

Going to go again for the non- veg very soon . |
 
Monkey Bar | Komal Agarwal | 34017613 | 3.5 | 2016-10-27 19:38:37 | The only good part about this place was the ambience and picturesque settings. Food is nothing worth mentioning. The spaghetti pasta was bad. Spring rolls & nachos were okay. Among the drinks, I really liked the Virgin Mangaa. |

Monkey Bar | Chandramouli Daga | 15803042 | 4.0 | 2016-10-24 20:41:36 | A sensational space with a terrific view of the Calcutta skyline. While it is expensive and the cocktails might not cater to everyone, the food is experimantally delicious while the service is admirable. 

Happening! And how! |
 
Monkey Bar | Moumita Das Talukdar | 343640 | 4.0 | 2016-10-24 20:01:03 | Visited this place at Fort Knox building 9th floor- the new outlet to party with friends. Gorgeous interiors and a stellar reputation as a chain we went there with high expectations and we were satisfied.Spectacular view with good music and awsum food. Innovative cocktails , lipsmacking pork and beef dishes.A must try joint. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anurag Jaiswal | 1778047 | 4.5 | 2016-10-24 18:14:19 | Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox building. The food & service are excellent. Ambiance is awesome. Per pax-Rs.1000 with drinks (inclusive of taxes) |
 
Monkey Bar | Sanjay Bhowmik | 29528004 | 4.0 | 2016-10-23 23:36:21 | I think I would rate this place 95% purely for the ambience and the view....the truly quintessential bar and cafe where you can have an awesome conversation at an awesome side table with an awesome view of the metropolis named Kolkata that I am yet to see anywhere in this city....truth be told, I was bedazzled and enamoured by the view....a whole 6/5!!!

Then comes the hard reality....for the few drinks (7), couple of coffee and a few bites, it was almost ‚Çπ4.2k....time to pay for the view!!!!....maybe a tinge more so 3.5/5....but the few hours spent are worth sitting there provided the company / conversation is good....

Nothing to write home about the food taste, just an avg 3.5/5

In the evening they have a good lighting set up and inspite of the crowd, every table and it's occupants had their own space and not intruded upon....it didn't feel cluttered like other such hallmark Kolkatan joints....would have gone for a 4.5/5 but they totally managed to screw that up with thumping music, which could have been easily done through the softer and low volume lounge music!!!...killed the evening ambience....if the idea was to attract the vibrant gen then they missed the fact that there were a whole lot of couples and a few bunch who were engrossed in their own conversation and seemed a bit irritated with the thumping bass....so here's a 3/5 for ruining the awesome layout and view....

If I would ever come again, it would be for the view and the window seats....but guys, do get some class in the music, the environment should provide for individual space, the layout, lighting, setting and ambience are awesome but your music settings are truly questionable, at least this time round!!! |

Monkey Bar | Sunanda Ghosh | 2720210 | 4.0 | 2016-10-20 12:21:51 | The newest addition to Camac Street, Monkey bar holds the promise of becoming one of the coolest hangouts for GenY. Situated on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building, it offers a panoramic view of the city through huge glass windows and what's more there's even arrangement for outdoor seating. The decor is charming and an awesome background score makes the ambience perfect for chilling out with your friends over great food and drinks. Firstly we ordered a butterfly chicken and duck pita pockets. The chicken was delicious and crispy tossed with bell peppers, chilli flakes and stuffed in crunchy butterfly shells and the duck meat marinated with spices and packed inside soft pita bread created fireworks in our mouths. We also went for a smoked chicken, chicken salami and harissa pizza which was superb, to say the least. There was another Hearty bowl, a heartwarming chicken broth with bean sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, flat noodles and bokchoy sprinkled with chilli oil. We finished off with Mobar Sundae Sandwich, an ice cream cake with nuts layered with nutella and tutti fruti. We also tried their hookah and the shisha is really good and strong. The service is more of less..efficient and the staff polite..but the pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side. They recently acquired their bar license, so would love to drop in again for a taste of their cocktails! |
 
Monkey Bar | Pamela Nandi | 2821382 | 3.0 | 2016-10-20 01:06:16 | No doubt this place has an amazing ambience with an indoor and outdoor seating area styled in the form of british pub, but food and service is very very poor.¬† We went on ashtami night with friends, they took about an hour to prepare the chicken stacked as saslik to grill it. Once served, the dish was just tasteless. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sunrita Sarkar | 804376 | 5.0 | 2016-10-18 22:44:36 | Hi, if you love Calcutta , good music(and by good music I mean led zeppelin and pink flyod and classics as such ) and a brilliant view of Calcutta, this is the place to be. 

We ordered a pack up punch, Sangria and a 100 pipers based cocktail. All three were pretty different and pretty well made. 

We didn't order any food as we were so engrossed in the decor and view. 

The hospitality was brilliant. 

Do give it a visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Aritra Roy | 145459 | 4.5 | 2016-10-17 22:31:23 | Already visited twice in such a short span of opening its doors in Kolkata, Monkey Bar has been fabulous on both occasions. Situated on the top floor of Fort Knox, it provides a magnificent view of the Kolkata skyline with Victoria Memorial, St Pauls Cathedral, Hooghly bridge and the 42 which is the tallest building here.

The food has been great and is presented in a unique way. Ordered Chilli Cheese dragons, Mac and cheese croquettes, Butterfly chicken and Chicken Chimichurri on the first time along with Mangaa mocktail. On the repeat, we ordered Mobar caramel ribs, Tiger beef, Reddys popcorn chicken alongwith a Smoked chicken pizza. In drinks, we had copper monkey , house made ginger beer with a couple of KF ultras.

However special mention must go to the desserts, Snicker bar is just too good while Nolen gur creme brulee was delicious.
They have a small open air area for hookah as well. The service is prompt and the ambience is quite relaxing. The bar looks pretty while the music changes over time with comforting tracks during evening to partying ones as the night progresses on.

Overall, the Kolkata gastropub scene is proud to have Monkey bar in its lineup. Hope it gets better from here.Cant wait to visit soon again :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Rupsha Bhadra | 606325 | 4.5 | 2016-10-16 14:33:22 | Monkey bar in Delhi is a location that is a part of some very special memories so I had really high expectations from its Calcutta counterpart. It certainly did not disappoint. We ordered loaded chicken nachos, the butter chicken kichdi, smoked chicken pizza and others. The butter chicken khichdi was really impressive. So were the cocktails Maanga and Copper monkey. A little on the higher side when it comes to the pocket pinch, monkey bar did live up to all the expectations. And the view is just fantastic. |
 
Monkey Bar | Madhurya Sarkar | 6309371 | 5.0 | 2016-10-16 12:11:35 | Just loved it.
The ambiance, the playlist, the skyline view, the staff management, the food and everything is just superb of this pub. This is located in the 9th floor of Knox building opposite to Urban desi. We visited late afternoon but the best time would be to hit this place in the evening. This can be an ideal place to go a date with your partner :)
The view of St. Paul's Cathedral, Victoria Memorial and Hooghly Bridge adds flavour to their ambiance.
Coming to food we had kingfisher premium beer, chicken wings and chocolate lava cake. All of the dishes were value for money. Overall had an excellent experience.
Coming back soon :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Syed Murtaza Jafar | 32607152 | 5.0 | 2016-10-16 04:52:57 | Ok, so same night we visited The Great Booze Story and Monkey Bar, and I'll say Monkey Bar won big time. Just opposite Urban Desi (will visit soon), good collection of music, courteous and attentive staff, this is one venue that you would want to visit again. The ambience, the view of the The Victoria Memorial is just a sight to look at. Safe to say, I'll be coming back to this place soon |
 
Monkey Bar | Preity | 27451267 | 4.5 | 2016-10-15 21:30:28 | Rare does it happen that you get good food at a bar and by the ambience of this place i expected nothing different..but to my surprise it was a very delightful experience..superbbbb food..good music, not too loud so you can chit chat with your friends..and very courteous staff..overall a very good experience..definitely coming back and soon... |

Monkey Bar | Rashmi Adhikary | 31014016 | 4.5 | 2016-10-14 14:26:12 | We visited Monkey Bar on Saptami evening, and had a spectacular time. The ambience is lively, the music is great, the decor very impressive and the service commendable.  
Now coming to the sumptuous meal; an assortment of drinks - whiskey, tequila, rum, virgin mojita, espresso -  was ordered with starters being Butterfly Chicken and Chicken Chapli. Yes, Butterfly Chicken is a definitely worth a try. In the main course, there was Aunty Vinnie's Berry Pulao. Tiger Beef was so delicious that two more dishes were ordered; this is must-try for beef lovers. This is the first place in Kolkata that I see so many beef dishes being offered. Galouti Killer was the other beef dish ordered and equally palatable. I had Mee Goreng which is an Indonesian dish of spiced noodles and got it topped with chicken. 
Overall, it was a great experience in this newly-opened gastropub. |
 
Monkey Bar | Piyush Dalmia | 15726652 | 4.5 | 2016-10-13 20:42:49 | Another fab newbie in the city

Talk about the Ambience, Food, Service or the Decor, it excels in all

Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building at Camac Street, it offers a spectacular view of the city
 
The Decor and Seating Arrangements are well made 

They got a separate smoking area which is quite airy, and has ample seating space as well

Shisha was pretty decent and lasted quite a while

Now lets talk about the protagonist here

Nachos were crisp and loaded with cheese, the Platter was appealing and featured variety of items whereas the mocktails were on fleek 

But things which really caught our attention were Spaghetti and Paneer Khidchi

While the former was extremely tasty, the latter is a MUST have dish for sure

All in all, it was a happy dining experience for us |
 
Monkey Bar | Arpita Agarwal | 998579 | 4.5 | 2016-10-13 12:39:47 | A new place in town, much awaited. Great ambience! The view is also super!! Maybe they should have had a slightly larger rooftop area. Food is decent too. The nachos were pretty good. The Manga is a must try!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sharmistha Mukherjee | 722185 | 4.5 | 2016-10-12 06:49:58 | If you are in Calcutta and love the skyline and a few drinks to go along with it on a hot, rainy or crisp evening this is the place to be. Monkey Bar in Calcutta is done up beautifully and affords you a view of the Victoria Memorial, St Paul's Cathedral and the Hoogly Bridge. The have cocktails and food over and above what they offer in other cities. The hipster smash is delicious to say the least. As was the bourbon cocktail with almond bitters... |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohit Suryawanshi | 36318376 | 5.0 | 2016-10-11 18:11:29 | My favourite lalmass Takos ,Pizza and Delicious Chillie cheese Dragon.
The friendliness of the staff seems genuine. I have never seen such good customer service as I experienced. |
 
Monkey Bar | FOODBUFFS | 987893 | 4.0 | 2016-10-11 11:16:14 | Visited on Ashtami night.Even though it was a good crowd,we managed to get a table immediately,courtesy to the experienced and efficient management team.There is an open-air seating which mainly caters to people ordering hookah or going there for a puff.Indoor seating is quite large.
Decor is akin to a British pub.Upholstery is comfortable.What allures you are those French windows through which you can catch a great glimpse of the city skyline,from the ninth floor.In the evenings there is muted lighting.Ambience is quite good.We heard some good old day soft music but as the night grew,the DJ started giving groovy yet classy numbers.
Service is warm and polite but there was a lack of professionalism.We were giving the same food order to two or three different men at times.The servers,even though quite courteous,were not quite clearly conversant about the food and beverages,unless asked upon.Details or any recommendations/suggestions were not given on their own.They need to more vocal  and well informed about every detail of the food when the order is being placed.
PAN RASNA HOOKAH-strong flavour,no choking but the smoke was quite weak,unlike to our liking.It was smooth but the smoke didnot last for an hour.It wasnot worth the price charged.Not satisfied.
BUTTERFLY CHICKEN-tastewise quite impressive.Chicken morsels were soft and had a sweet tangy taste.The sauce was pretty good and spicy and the butterfly shells were crispy,the whole presentation looked lovely.Three butterflies were there.
REDDY'S CHICKEN POPCORN-Well this dish took us to South India.Moderately sized chicken morsels deep fried in a batter having a crisp crunchy texture and the taste was so consistent in southern flavours,it tasted good.Curry leaves flavour was predominant and we liked it a lot to go for a second order.
CHICKEN CHIMICHURI-Chicken was soft.They were skewed up but the flavours were quite bland,didnot stand up to our expectations.Not impressive at all,this dish needs improvement.
MEDITERRANEAN PLATTER-Mixed comments.It was great in some parts,not so great in others.Chickpea fries were not so good to taste,seemed a bit too fried where the chickpea stuffing was too less.The pita breads were nice,soft,fluffy,buttered and nicely grilled,tasted good.Hummus was in great quantity,tastewise perfect but the babaghanoush didnot stand out in taste.Cheese filo wraps tasted good.They  had soft spinach with gooey cheese inside wrapped in rice papers and fried.Overall a good dish,you can give it a try if Mediterranean cuisine is your calling.
OLD MONK(EY) CHOCOLATE CAKE-Good.Cake was melt in mouth soft and creamy.Consistency of cream was smooth,light and fluffy.The dessert was classy,superb and hence recommended.
Foodwise we were not that satisfied as much as we were with their cocktails!!
Their BOURBON LIIT,MAD MEN and MAMA'S GIRL were just bang on!The bartender did a great job.The blend was great,the liquor gave a great kick,courtesy the good mixing.They were well balanced in flavours and the ingredients of the drinks very well complimented each other.Spices and mint went well with vodka,and coffee with whisky surely made a great pair.
We also ordered Heineken,Ginger ale and fresh lime soda which was usual.
As far as price is concerned,it is too high for the food and some cocktails! Quantity of food is very less,so doesnot justify the price and tastewise it didnot make a good mark.The cocktails had a price tag which was same as most gastropubs having a good establishment cost,yet they were high.
This pub is a must visit,esp for their awsome cocktails.The gastronome part needs improvement to call it a fair gastropub.Will visit again for sure owing to the overall good experience that we had,a good hangout place and to try other cocktails and entr√©es. |

Monkey Bar | Sreyashi M. | 10853321 | 4.5 | 2016-10-09 19:05:16 | Visited today for lunch, and a had a lovely time! 
I suggest you get a table by the windows. The Kolkata skyline will definitely make your visit even more memorable. 
We tried the Maanga cocktail (5 stars, peeps!) with the Tiger Beef. I suggest you try both. Succulent meat with the zing of your drink makes for some very happy (read: tipsy) people. 
For mains, we tried the Mobar burger and it was heavenly! The Naga pork soulful bowl was fabulous too! Portions are great, flavour is gorgeous and staff is super sweet and nice. 
I hope you maintain what you've got going so I can visit again! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sudipto Mitra | 2401672 | 3.5 | 2016-10-09 09:00:39 | Nice decor , awsum view of the cityscape and great cocktails . Food is good to average with a twist and may not be liked by all.
We ordered pitchers of pack a punch,mangaa amd mohjito and the first is the best.

We stuck with finger food only and ordered 
Mushroom bruschetta(good),prawn pil pil(gr8), chicken churi(avg) and tiger beef(gr8)
Rounded everything off with aunty berry pulao which was delicious
 This a typical gastro bar with foot tapping music which is too loud at times, we had to ask it to be turned down.

The service could have been bettet and there  was confusion while seating. We were waiting at the bar for our table to be ready but some other guests jumped on that

Oh forgot to mention a outing here will surely burn a whole in your pocket |
 
Monkey Bar | Vedant Kabra | 2240676 | 4.5 | 2016-10-09 08:47:40 | I went to monkey bar last night and I was pretty surprised. Read all the reviews and thoroughly analysed the place in my mind before I went there (it's what I do). 
The guy at the front desk (I believe he was the owner) was phenomenal. So welcoming, so easy going and so 'approachable'. The one at the front desk is the face of any restaurant. He told us we'll have to wait for 40, but we got a table in 20. Told us we'll have to share the table - but eventually we didn't have to. 
I think seating right outside the kitchen + bar worked for us. Didn't have to wait for the food (the cheese drum, nachos and mushroom + truffle oil pizza are INSANE). Ordered quite a bit on the liquor front - barring the martini everything else was really good (fun presentation too!) (including the ginger beer). We had heard so much about the desserts - total let down though (chocolava cake with mint ice cream was terrible I must confess - Mezzuna gets the big ups here). 
The staff was pretty alright (looked a little confused at times). 
Monkey bar must work on guest management (but it is only a few weeks old so it's okay). Thoroughly impressed with the ambience (trumps Mezzuna and all the other hot spots in the city several times over), food, booze and service. 
This place has my highest recommendation. |
 
Monkey Bar | Argha Basu | 1892606 | 5.0 | 2016-10-08 15:46:45 | If you want to impress your girlfriend or wife . Just take her there . Take your seat next to the glass wall and enjoy the panaromic view of the Victoria memorial, Vidyasagar Setu and the Howrah Bridge.

Monkey Bar | Puja Das | 36272619 | 4.5 | 2016-10-08 12:52:12 | Bookmarks . ¬†It's got an amazing atmosphere with outdoor and indoor seating. Despite going on the weekend it gets the right amount of crowd that makes it a very happening place. Music was really good. We wanted to try a new cocktail, so we went for the ¬†toast to calcutta which was a little different and tasted quite good. Food on the other hand was quite unique. 
service is also impressed us. ¬† ¬†

The place is a little hard to find. But overall it's a nice place for the weekend chill! |
 
Monkey Bar | Tejash | 15384381 | 1.5 | 2016-10-08 11:33:48 | Visited this place on 7th October with friends. We were a group of 11 but there is no place for such big group there.  The table we were given was ideal for 7 but we had to squeeze in.  Repeated request for chair felt to deaf ears till such time my friend pulled up the bar chair from the adjacent table. They have limited staff and one server was alloted to the tables.  Needless to say the service was pathetic and totally unacceptable. Our order for beer and ginger ale took 30 mins and after repeated reminders it arrived.  The food is average with limited option for Vegetarian. No one wants to eat "baigan pakora " or " vada pav" at such a place.  We were charged for one item that was ordered but not served. On pointing the same the server "argued" that we didn't realise but it was indeed served to us.  In no mood to hang around any more we just paid and left.  While waiting down for our car we met others who too were very disappointed with the place. 

This will be one of those places in kolkata that will soon be ticked off based on word or mouth and customer experience because of shabby service and attitude of the people who run it. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anshuman Jalan | 31752408 | 2.0 | 2016-10-08 00:20:08 | Good atmoshpere ! Average food for vegie lovers ! Place to chill and soak in the music and buzz around . Nothing home to write about the food . And weekend and holidays . aVOID as unable to give service due to rush |
 
Monkey Bar | Darshana Rampuria | 2855224 | 3.5 | 2016-10-05 11:34:14 | So finally visited Monkey Bar ! The ambience is good as compared to What we get to see in Kolkata.. but apart from that nothing spectacular and surely cannot be compared to the one in Mumbai ! The food is Too average . We had ordered the Nachos - this one was a disaster , pesto spaghetti ( penne pasta wasn't there!!) - yet again very bland and just not up to the mark . Though tempura and mezze platter was good BUT the Coconut ice cream Dessert was FABULOUS SO an extra 0.50 points for that !! Food needs to be worked upon , staff is courteous ! Best wishes .. hoping my next visit be better and with no complains ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sujan Das | 36218418 | 4.5 | 2016-10-03 14:04:44 | I went this place with my friends and I would say this was amazing and was full packed in the weekend without liquor. There ambiance was very good and the music they place is also very nice . There drinks where also very good . They smoking and non smoking area also which was the best part of this place. Good place to spend with your friends. As we been to many other bars but I love this place as they have place to sit and there service was also excellent. They where pack but still there people know how to attend the gust which was very good in this bar. Pocket friendly and staff was excellent smiling and they working and they suggest also if you are new to this place and don't know what to order. I would suggest everyone for this place and sure you will be in love with this place. I basically tried everything on the menu (food and beverage), and yes it is all worth every penny
, I m fan of there menu and food, really enjoyed.¬†

Monkey Bar | Soul !! | 32140714 | 4.5 | 2016-10-03 08:50:51 | In a word, wonderful. We been to Delhi Monkey but this is the best one with wonderful view. 
One thing we really missed the Foosball) 
But no matter we had great time, fantastic food, we order lot many things forget the name but pizza and starters are yumm, drinks are also really nice
Staff were very welcoming too.

So keep good work guys !! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sarat | 8743511 | 3.0 | 2016-10-03 01:16:59 | ambience is good.. was excited to reach the place.. view n open air is also impressive.. u get a glimpse of the Victoria memorial
Although can't talk about the cocktails(coz we wet on 2nd oct, dry day), but we had the copper monkey mocktail and a ginger beer, we were very happy with both
But sadly food was extremely disappointing.. taste as well as quality is not upto the mark.. ordered the much talked about chicken butterfly, too sweet, no flavour of chicken n tasted Lyk beans on toast
Second ordered the spicy tomato spaghetti, worst I hav ever had, tasted like Maggi with tomato
Butter chicken khichadi was good,,, good innovation
Snickerbar, dessert, was well mind blowing if u hav a sweet tooth.. very nice and balanced taste
But the whole dining experience was not satisfactory |
 
Monkey Bar | Nikita Ramgarhia | 903737 | 2.5 | 2016-10-01 10:11:42 | An over hyped place.
The only plus points are the ambience and the service.
The hookah is average and food simply disappoints.
The vada pao is good.
The Mac and cheese croquettes have peas in them..like who does peas with cheese and Mac..
Too bad with the experimentation guys..
And the potato rackett is also very bland.
Galauti is average..
You guys are better in other cities I have heard..so pls improve in Kolkata |
 
Monkey Bar | Bindu | 36159071 | 3.5 | 2016-09-29 00:55:19 | At last chef manu chandra with his concept of monkey bar has entered in Kolkata.but sorry to say the food and service has dissapointed on comparison with the monkey bars in bombay and bangalore.
Need to check before its too late its my first experience but once more will love to try so that they can still improvise. |
 
Monkey Bar | Harish Todi | 1076456 | 2.0 | 2016-09-28 00:28:12 | The place is worst ever in all places that I do visit. What it seems from outside is not at all from inside. It's totally a different one and thats very disappointing for me. The hookah was so bad that I just left it after once. It was all a waste of money for me and that too a huge waste as it is very costly as per their brand name , but it's sad to say that it couldn't carry it'd brand name at all. |
 
Monkey Bar | Hardik Daga || Kolkata Epicurean | 9516701 | 4.0 | 2016-09-26 23:52:06 | Location-Fort knox building(9th floor),Camac street.

Finally "Monkey bar" has opened its gate to kolkata.After establishing itself in Mumbai,Delhi and Bangalore its opening in kolkata was much awaited.This place is totally a fresh take on gastrobar culture.As we entered we were totally astonished with the beauty of this place.The best part about this place was the swanky interiors and the dazzling view.The menu was mouthwatering and creation of one of the finest chef Manu Chandra.But along with whole lot of positive aspects this place has its negative side too and that is its service and price.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is extremely calm and soothing.The interiors are extremely high-toned.The place is divided into two sections(Smoking and Non Smoking area)which is appreciated.And atlast for this segment,we can bet that this place has the best view in comparison to any of the eateries in Kolkata.

Service-We were extremely disappointed with the service at this place.The staff was extremely confused with our seating.They took about 15 minutes to make us sit and also the table on which we were seated was already reserved by someone due to which we have to change our table in between.We also have to urge them many a times to serve us water and take the order for the food.But on the other side we saw that the staff was trained very well with the dishes and helped us to choose the right dishes according to our starvation.

Food-The food at this place was good in taste but what astonished us the most was their presentation,it was just praise-worthy.We had-
1:Med platter
2:Spicy panner bhurji buns
3:Chilli cheese dragons

Among them our favourite was "Med platter".We also had sheesha at this place which we find extremely expensive.It cost us around 800+taxes.

Food-4/5
Service-3/5
Ambiance-4.5/5

This place is a must visit for experiencing its Ambiance and food oresentation.üòÉüòÉ |
 
Monkey Bar | Ritwika Pal | 172912 | 4.0 | 2016-09-26 10:27:27 | Woo another gastropub in town, I was super excited to explore this new place. Unfortunately they not yet started with alcohol. But yes for compensation they have this Non alcoholic beer in their menu card. Which is more like a ginger ale.¬†
Food is awesome we tried Sticky Korean Chicken Wings and Prawn Pil Pil for which is can give 5/5. |
 
Monkey Bar | Manish Jhawar | 2238114 | 4.5 | 2016-09-26 00:59:53 | Different menu........v gud ambience.......gud view.........gud food!!
Nice place ... Shld visit...

Monkey Bar | Vikash Kumar Singh | 32056738 | 2.0 | 2016-09-25 23:21:32 | Went to this place on 25th of September. The best part of this hotel is the view of Victoria + Vidyasagar Setu. Food is ok types. Service needs to improve. Didnt like that much. |
 
Monkey Bar | Shakshi Bajaj | 34222951 | 4.0 | 2016-09-25 21:50:03 | Had recently visited the place.  Ambience was really good.  Soothing music and ample space worked well for me.  All the people were very courteous and response was very quick. We ordered nachos,  potato with rachlette cheese and pizza.  The food was yummmm. We asked for out of the menu toppings for pizza and they were more than happy to serve.  It was a pleasant experience. |
 
Monkey Bar | Samrat Banerjee | 984442 | 3.0 | 2016-09-25 18:48:36 | Visited the place on 24Sep. A mix of pro's and cons. Remarkably expensive, considering service is yet to reach premium standards. Yet to get a bar license, staff seems confused about where to seat you if you walk in as a couple. While the outdoor sitting layout is nice, it's primarily used as a hookah space by boisterous youngsters, and the seating layout is remarkably cramped. Service also is a minus here with the server not asking or serving water if not called to do so. Portions are quite small against the charges. Chicken Chimichuri was good, folks lovers which was 3 cutlets of bhekti coated and fried was ok. The mushroom pizza was definitely a let down. With 2 soft drinks the tab came to ‚Çπ1650+. Not worth a revisit soon. |
 
Monkey Bar | Abhishek Agarwal | 2897244 | 3.5 | 2016-09-25 03:13:53 | Was on the bucket list since it opened... So
We ordered a hookah but it failed my expectations... We tried out the tacos which was really nice... Service was on the slower side.... Definitely a lot to improve..
But then having ur food wit hookah nd Victoria memorial to look over.. The view is breathtaking..
But u need to live up to the name...
Hope to b back soon.... Nd wish to see a Better Trained Monkeyüëç |
 
Monkey Bar | Santosh Singhal | 27588565 | 5.0 | 2016-09-24 22:50:00 | An excellent place The sitting arrangement nice with a separate hukka place is very good 
The choice of menu is very good Everything is so so good & has a perfect taste According to me this is the first place where I did not have to add anything Desserts r very good Good Sevice Keep it upüëç |
 
Monkey Bar | Avijit Biswas | 1095896 | 4.5 | 2016-09-24 13:18:25 | Kolkata welcomes Monkey Bar with whole hearted love and appreciation... and they deserve it... no doubts about that...

Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox, Camac Street... and I will suggest everyone to go there during the evening... you guys will get mesmerized with the view of our City of Joy... I bet no other gustopub have such plus point till date in Kolkata... they have an excellent intero which you can enjoy anytime... also the outdoor seating is pretty attracting...

Monkey Bar | Shourya Sengupta | 2357486 | 4.5 | 2016-09-23 21:51:57 | Brilliant food! Loved the wide choice of meat. Please keep up the good work! Look forward to having the Galouti Killer, next time since it was not available. |
 
Monkey Bar | Siddhi Newatia | 3761881 | 3.0 | 2016-09-23 21:24:05 | Amazing ambience..very spacious, drinks menu could Hav had more variety..hated the mangaa drink..i found it too sour..the pizza and chilli cheese dragons were good. |
 
Monkey Bar | Harsh Bathwal | 1481844 | 3.5 | 2016-09-21 23:42:47 | Visited here for the first time. The food menu is different from what you come across usually in other restaurants. I think it's a perfect date spot as it has a beautiful Victoria building's view which looks amazing at night. Also the music was superb.
Pocket pinch : 600-700 per head. ( Food and mocktail) |
 
Monkey Bar | Shikha Ojha | 2112728 | 4.5 | 2016-09-18 01:48:05 | Amazing decor and awesome food. They had an outdoor sitting too which had a big screen playing Mickie and Minnie black and white cartoon synchronized with the songs being played. The cost is on the higher side but if you want to pamper yourself or people you love, this is the place to be. The amazing view is icing on the cake. |
 
Monkey Bar | Utsav Agarwal | 31137221 | 1.5 | 2016-09-17 22:49:13 | There is a difference in Bangalore wen it compares to Kolkata one , seriously don't no d reason but it needs to upgrade it very soon as in Bangalore. 
Specifically, the property is pretty old for a brand like dis 
According to me Monkey bar is just not another lounge but a more of a culture which in itself |
 
Monkey Bar | Arnav Jhunjhunwala | 22857974 | 5.0 | 2016-09-16 21:28:37 | The best place to hangout now. Food quality is excellent and many of the dishes aren't available anywhere in Kolkata. The key lime pie is unbelievable and a must have each time you go. |
 
Monkey Bar | Tanya Sen | 496614 | 5.0 | 2016-09-15 00:44:28 | The moment you walk in to this restaurant you're going to notice the long french windows and ofcourse the most beautiful view which includes victoria memorial. The ambience is lovely, very warm and urban. We ordered Aam Pannas, Tiger beef, Prawn Ghee Roast, Pepper Calamari. All of them were to die for. For dessert we ordered Nolen gurer creme br√ªl√©e. Yumm yumm!! I would totally come again. Loved itüòä |
 
Monkey Bar | Sourav Mukherjee | 306717 | 4.5 | 2016-09-14 11:38:19 | Finally they have arrived in Kolkata after rocking Delhi , Mumbai , Bangalore etc. and a few of Corporate Monkeys could muster the courage and had enough stock of lame excuses (for residential purposes only) to visit this joint on the lazy Saturday afternoon last week. Very conveniently located at Camac Street , innovative food & drinks menu like Kerala Rice , Butterfly Chicken , Prawn Pil Pil and many more.¬† Personally I loved the ginger beer. It was a full house and it is nice to see that City of Joy has lapped up the Monkey Bar and the legendary versatile gastronomical journey of Kolkata has just added yet another feather . Must visit joint for foodies and a great place to unwind. Wishing luck and Highly recommended !!!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Siddhartha Chowdhary | 211170 | 4.0 | 2016-09-14 00:31:42 | Dim lights and chic interiors. A totally fresh take on gastropub culture. The place was almost full when we entered so 9 of us had to accommodate on a smaller table. They weren't serving alcohol today, and for the next few days also they are keeping the bar closed. we had to compromise on that and had to order the virgins. We had the much hyped 'maanga' which was nice and refreshing. Homemade ginger beer was good. Brownie cookie shake wasn't available. For starters we had chilli cheese dragons, cheese filled cigar rolls with spicy garlic sauce, the sauce was amazing. Rock Corn tempura was good, crisp and the teriyaki sauce was appropriately done. Loaded nachos was amazing. Potato with raclette which was fried potatoes topped with stringy mozzarella cheese, was basic and slightly spiced toped with pickled jalape√±os. We also ordered two types of pizza , roasted zucchini with parmesan and tomatoes and the other, mushrooms with truffle oil. I loved the mushroom one over the zucchini one. But the pizza looked a bit messy and wasn't also evenly crisp. Overall the service was spontaneous and amiable. I liked the overall experience though. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Chopra | 34103337 | 4.5 | 2016-09-13 20:44:04 | Monkey Bar is a grown up version of a slightly more casual neighborhood bar. With about 300+ gastro pubs in India it is only a matter of time when people start aping. The Calcutta version is setting it apart from the rest of the so called gastro pubs.

We had the good fortune of going to the private opening of Monkey Bar Kolkata on the 1st September, 2016. It was a small party for about a 100 people. The mood was up beat and there was a sense of relief and satisfaction on the staff who were hosting us. It has taken Monkey Bar Kolkata a little over 8 months to complete the restaurant.

The staff is from all across the country. This makes for some good interaction with them ‚Äì that is if you care to chat them up. The cocktails are more involved. There is reasonable work that is done to create the drinks behind the counter. Work as in ingredients have been mixed and labor have been put in to create a concoction or mixes. Not just opening bottles and squirting premixes in a shaker and serving things up. Almost like an artisan touch. The bases are fermented in house; you can see the large glass jars filled and sitting happy on the bar counter.

To begins with the view is something you must visit let alone anything else. Add the food and you have method to mayhem. The care that goes in the food here is evident when you have your first bites. With Chef Manu Chandra at the helm of the kitchen things are definitely going to have certain standards in terms of flavor and quality. There is always going to be a reason behind why what ever has been done to the food in the kitchen here at Monkey Bar.

Expect massive flavors and good service. In fact it is so good to see the city opening up to the kinds of Monkey Bar. This is a place where you can come in and kick back with friends on a weekend. This is one tree that we two monkeys are happy to call home. |
 
Monkey Bar | Jayeeta Basu | 360426 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 21:01:52 | So finally Kolkata gets Monkey Bar!! 
I have always loved the Bangalore  and the Mumbai Monkey Bar because of the ambience.  
First day, the space and the view is amazing!! They had a very limited drinks menu considering first day. I had Toast to Calcutta, Manga and Copper Grin. Toast to Calcutta was refreshing, adding smoke gondhoraj lebu,  it tasted even better.  Manga is something I have drank before.  Copper Grin was okay. 
Let's get into the food menu.  Prawn ghee roast,  Vada Pav,  Keema Pav the menu took me back to Bombay and South. 
I had the Korean sticky wings,  since I already came to Monkey Bar  after having dinner,  I sticked to one starter and drinks!
I am planning to head back to Monkey Bar pretty soon for full fledged meal and lot of Toast to Calcutta! 
Please stock the bar as it is extremely disappointing to come to Monkey Bar and sit with limited choices in terms of alcohol. |
 
Monkey Bar | Arushi Dhupia | 1597321 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 19:14:22 | Monkey Bar is on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building on camac. Visit in the evening and if you're sitting by the window panes, you can see the Victoria Memorial, lights twinkling from The 42, and the outline of a part of the Parama flyover. It's so cool! 
The music is good and the place has a very funky feel to it. The food is good, not excellent. 
Loved the pizza and the Med platter.  Corn kernels were okayish. 
The Loaded Nachos were Brilliant!! Lots of sour cream and Mexican beans and fully loaded as the name suggests! No other places in kolkata (apart from the Big Nachos at |
 
Monkey Bar | Shhashee Churiwala | 2053496 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 23:48:39 | The newest hub in kolkata with different design and fresco depicting old kolkata. The giant size windows showing the serene skyline of the city. Exhaustive menu with both indian and international cuisine with a twist. Prompt service , great tasting dishes both starters and mains accompanied humble pricing. A great place to kill your hunger. All in all good experience after a long time. A must visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Aihik Barua | 1850614 | 3.5 | 2016-09-11 22:10:16 | This review might change. This post is influenced mostly due to the nonavailability of alcohol , and I did see two or three bottles of liquor , anyway , about the interiors and location , bloody superb amazing selection , love it , would suggest it anybody , the bartenders ( coke tenders üòÇ) seemed cocky , but it's a relief to see a high end restaurant serving beef, that's fresh and the it was good actually , would go again for the booze ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Mansi Tulshan | 33240285 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 21:17:40 | Went there in the evening today to check out all the hype surrounding it. Guess what! Wasn't disappointed at all. We took a seat right next to the window(yes, I have a fascination for tables next to Windows) and was mesmerised by the breathtaking view of the city. The music, ambience were perfect for a chilled out evening with a great date(note:my husband).
The lemon iced tea was very good.. Perfect in taste. The staff recommended ' the med platter 'as a great vegetarian option and we decided to try that. The platter had falafel, pita pockets, cheese and spinach filos, and the usual dips. The hummus was great and we were serves a hearty portion if it which made us happy coz it's the dips which usually are heroes of this dish. The babagonoush was great and it had a smokey taste which was really good. The curd and cucumber dip definitely needs improvement. It was runny and tasted like buttermilk! Had no taste and we left most of it. The best part of the ambience was hookah had a separate enclosure and wasn't served inside the main restaurant! Will definitely return to this place for a relaxing evening! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sajid Feroz | 60540 | 1.0 | 2016-09-11 17:20:01 | New place and pathetic service....guy at the reception refused to give a table coz I was alone and suggested a table outside in open when it was so  hot outside.After a while I was a given a table with no seat n ws suggested to stand n eat (brilliant!) Although after some protest a seat was provided.i even noticed couples were asked to share a table even when some of the tables were empty ! It was quite bizzare !! imagine going on a double date with some strangers ! It was like they just wanted to give table to group of 4 or more ,again like I said restaurant was not even full!

Food was served ..I ordered a prawn dish ,peach ice tea and the snicker bar for dessert.prawn dish was good ,the ice tea wasn't served n after 45 minutes of ordering I was told it's not available .the snicker bar was good (recommended) !! Some how all the servers were lost in their own world ,roaming around in groups n hardly paying attention to customers ..that too when there was no rush at all ! 
 
I am not tat critical while writing reviews but m quite surprised how casual the staff was while handling their customers (that too being a new place in town).I have been to monkey bar in Delhi and tat place is amazing ! 

Service - 0/5
Decor -4/5 (lovely view of Victoria memorial n hoogly bridge ) 
Food - 3.5 (would love to explore more) 

Must have - the snicker bar |
 
Monkey Bar | Aadarsh Agarwal | 1183989 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 17:18:45 | The ambience and location of the place was top notch. With the bar not licensed yet the food surely compensated. There is a separate outdoor section for shisha takers. Lastly, the view of Victoria was the cherry on the cake. |
 
Monkey Bar | Reevu Wangdi | 284286 | 5.0 | 2016-09-11 00:42:46 | Great place to chill & dine... best thing is they serve beef...Tiger beef was succulent and spiced to perfection... Korean bulgogi beef rice was flavoursome ... chorizo pork pav was delicious... ampanna done right... and service was tops... gonna be back when the bar opens ..I believe next week it is... good going .. |
 
Monkey Bar | Devanshi Powani | 33090142 | 3.5 | 2016-09-10 23:54:27 | The snicker bar desert and the Aam aadmi eggs were the highlight of our dinner. Can't wait for the bar to start . Loved the service and the ambience. |
 
Monkey Bar | Jashita Ray | 589467 | 4.0 | 2016-09-09 19:52:29 | Had been waiting eagerly for the opening of Monkey Bar and there I was dragging my fiance, paying a visit in the first week itself. However I would say i rather got slightly disappointed. The staff seemed amateur. They were very amiable but highly confused. Firstly it took them over 20-25mins with repetitive reminders to serve us water. And further disappointment was on asking for the drinks menu, they informed us they didn't have license for alcohol. Thus we had to settle for mocktails. The person who took our mocktail order was so confused. He was unsure of the mocktails on offer, we had to specifically cue him with names like green apple or blue lagoon etc. And oh, there was no paper napkins, spoons and forks or sauces kept on the table for us as some had mentioned in previous reviews - we had to ask for them. Probably they don't have them kept in advance in the open air section.
Now the good part - Everything else!
The ambience - Wow. The view of the Victoria Memorial is simply stunning. You can just sit and spend hours adoring your surroundings.
We ordered a teen paan hookah, along with a Virgin Mangaa- Loved it and a Green Apple Soda which was decent, not that great. Next on our list were the Butterflies, Rooster Booster Burger & Chicken 65. The first two were mouthwatering, especially the burger - juicy, filling, yummilicious. And then the cherry on the pie - the dessert - Snicker bar- I genuinely recommend this. Loved the way they serve it and the taste is heavenly.
Overall, had a lovely evening with the MoBar Mojo! Just wished I could give it a 5 star rating. |
 
Monkey Bar | Luna Chatterjee (Madly_Food_Lover) | 1304639 | 4.5 | 2016-09-09 01:36:56 | The Monkey has finally swung east, and that too it's making it's presence felt !! After Mumbai and Delhi now Kolkata hasit own "Monkey Bar". 
To start with It's an amazing property that has a breathtaking view. You can just gaze at Kolkata skyline while sipping some amazing cocktails.
Curated by acclaimed chef Manu Chandra, Monkey Bar's menu boasts of innovative food and drinks. I absolutely loved each and everything that i tasted but some of the items and drinks need spl mention.
Kerala Rice Salad- A salad made with wild red rice, blended with herbs and topped with curd chilli, the dish is indigenous and light.
Med Platter-A dish which is a visual delight in itself apart from being a total amalgamation of fritters and dips.
Tikki of Joy- A perfect dish to satisfy the bong fish craving.
Butterfly Chicken- Chicken blended with herbs placed inside a butterfly shaped shell.
Prawn Pil Pil- Perfectly prepared Prawn served with bread. Simple yet delicious
Laal Maas Phulka Tacos-Rajasthani laal mash intelligently placed inside tacos, a perfect fusion food.
Spare Pork Ribs- This is ansolutely recommended for those pork lovers. The meat is tender and cooked to perfection in barbecue sauce.
The drinks served quenched our thirst perfectly, among them some needs spl mentionlike Manga, Copper Monkey, Pink Punch. 
The desserts are absolutely delightful.Gondhoraj Lemon Tart is sweet, with a bit of tang!! There is Snicker Bar whichbis total bliss.
So with the coming of Monkey Bar i can safely say that gastronomic revolution has indeed hit our City of Joy. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anamitraa/The Gut Filling | 671420 | 4.0 | 2016-09-09 00:46:21 | The City of Joy is witnessing a major change in the gastronomic culture post the technological revolution of smartphones and wireless technology. There has been evolution of the global food and Calcuttans are gradually getting used to it. After many multinational and national pubs coming to Kolkata, it was the turn for Monkey Bar to refresh Kolkata with its gracious presence.

This 3rd September, I was invited to the Pre Launch of the Kolkata Chapter where the #MonkeySwungEast. It was a lovely happy afternoon where all the foodies, bloggers, critics and experts had a gala time with beautiful cocktails, mocktails and great good.

The place is located at the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building in Camac Street. Blessed with a wonderful view, you can see the Victoria Memorial, St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral and Hooghly Bridge altogether. We had to pick up paper pieces with names of cocktails and sit at the assigned table to participate in games and quizzes. It was a lot of fun. Ambience is all classy with the bar and high chair along with couches. I loved the wall art on the gateway to the open air sitting area which is done with Gupi Bagha, Tana Rickshaw and all the nostalgic memoirs of Kolkata.

The food was equally good. There were many cocktails and I, being a teetotaler had the virgin versions of all the drinks. Some of them were great, actually. We had ‚Äì

Kerala Red Rice Salad - Baby spinach, red rice, raw mango, coconut, peanuts and upmensinkai (salted chilli from Karnataka). I generally do not eat chillies, but this one was so good. Loved it a lot.

Mac & Cheese Croquettes ‚Äì Golden fried broccoli and peas along with chilli mayo and salsa. I am a fan of cheese. So the croquettes were really admired.

Med Platter - Falafel, spinach, cheese filo parcels, hummus, smoked baba ganoush, roasted peppers, olives, with pita bread and labneh. The presentation of this platter was really an eye catching one. It was really good.

Smoked Beetroot and Beans Galouti - Melt in mouth vegetarian galouti on saffron laced taftan, onion and mint chutney. This dish too was okay.

Baked Brie ‚Äì Oh! I loved this dish. Brie cheese with filo surrounded by pineapple salsa. The cheese oozing out of the pastry created all the sensation. Loved this dish a lot. Had a huge share of it from my table.

Prawn Pil Pil - Tossed in olive oil with chilli, garlic and parsley. It was served with garlic rubbed toast. This was extremely delicious. Loved the dish a lot specially for its aroma and the garlic breads, specially.

Tikki of Joy - Kolkata inspired Bhetki fish cutlets with kasundi, fennel seed & coriander, served with mint chutney. This is one classic dish which no Calcuttan will ever fail to love. I was no exception.

Tiger Beef - Slices of steak tossed with chilli paste, black beans, galangal, ginger, bean sprouts, lemon, bok choy and peppers. This dish was a bit spicy, not suited to my taste but loved by my fellow foodies at the table.

Butterfly Chicken - Sweet, spicy, crispy bits of chicken tossed with sesame, chilli, honey and peppers; stuffed in our signature butterfly shells. The butterfly shells resembled to a savoury treat from the lands of Andhra Pradesh, popularly known as Phoolbu. This dish was unique, in presentation and taste.

Laal Maas Phulka Tacos ‚Äì Who doesn‚Äôt know about this classical delicacy of Rajasthan? Monkey Bar has successfully fused this Indian beauty along with Mexican Tacos. This twist in the cuisines creates the beauty of the culinary culture and here lies the skill of a chef, who is an artist in this case. Loved this dish for the innovation.

Spare Pork Ribs ‚Äì Trust me, it is the best pork dish I have had till date. The pork was so soft, juicy and tender that it literally melted inside the mouth. It was tossed in a tangy and sweet sauce which was really good. Writing the review after 5-6 days but I still can‚Äôt get over the beauty of the pork ribs.

Gondhoraj Lime Tart ‚Äì This was one unique dessert we have tried there. Lemon curd, torched meringue, lemon & mint gel, pistachio cake & cookie crust ‚Äì combination of all good things at one go. Loved the refreshing vibe of this dessert.

The Snicker Bar ‚Äì I am not a big Snicker fan. But this dessert along with the perfect swirls of the s‚Äômore has become one of the desserts to crave for at the strangest of times. Milk chocolate ganache, dark chocolate micro cake, hazelnut praline cream, salted caramel gel being the composition of this dessert, I loved it till the end.

Drinks ‚Äì Copper Monkey, Manga, Pack of Punch, Toast To Calcutta, Mad Men. I was in Team Copper Monkey. Had the virgin version of all the drinks. Liked the Manga to be the best, which they claim to be one of their signature cocktails along with Copper Monkey, which was also very good.

I would like to thank the nationally acclaimed figure Chef Manu Chandra to spend and share his valuable words about food and Team Monkey Bar for having us over and presenting a lifetime of memories. Best wishes to the team and may they prosper ahead. Happy Dining! :) |
 
Monkey Bar | The Hungry Desis (Ramya & Chiranjeev) | 30569103 | 4.5 | 2016-09-08 16:29:59 | Monkey Bar has finally come to the City of Joy and promises to be a perfect place to have fun and relax. When we walked into the gastropub, the first thing that came to our minds was "classy and quirky".¬†
The best of it all is the stunning view.  You have a clear sight of the St. Paul's Cathedral and the Victoria Memorial in the distance. The service staff are swift and attentive.
 Another thoughtful design is the assortment of condiments and cutlery set on the tables. You can use them as you like instead of calling for the servers everytime. The cocktails are innovative, using a variety of ingredients and the food is lip-smackingly delicious! Our recommendations are the Mangaa and the Tipsy Sherbet among the drinks. With regards to the food, the vegetarian dishes are as good as the non vegetarian ones. We suggest the Med Platter and the Baked Brie among the vegetarian choices. For the non-vegetarians, the Prawn Pil Pil is a must try. To achieve full satiisfaction, do sample the Snicker Bar..it is to die for! |
 
Monkey Bar | Varnika | 380228 | 4.5 | 2016-09-07 10:06:59 | The wait is finally over. The moment you enter Monkey Bar, you get the feel of the one in Bangalore. The open air area is simply amazing, the view of Victoria Memorial is breathtaking. 
I loved the ambience of the inner section as well. Even though it has some basic monkey bar elements missing the place is great overall. 
We ordered the MoBar Classic Chilli Cheese Dragons which were to die for. 
For drinks we had the Copper One which was quite bad. It didn't taste of Alcohol at all. 
Taste of Calcutta was refreshing and nice. Pack a punch was also decent. 
All in all once they start functioning full time and properly it will be a great place. Super excited! |
 
Monkey Bar | Roli Vajpeyi | 909801 | 5.0 | 2016-09-06 23:07:49 | Monkey bar finally opens in Kolkata! You guys are in for a treat the cocktails are so unique and nice you can't just order one! And the snacks are just awesome. This is my new hang out place. The desserts specially the snickers one is just amazing. |

Saldanha Bakery | Shaurya Pathak | 367302 | 4.0 | 2016-12-17 21:09:23 | It will be a time taking process to find this place. But it will test your resolve for the love of food.
Don't look around. Just look down and enjoy the lip smacking goodies. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Kashif Ahmed | 1115831 | 4.5 | 2016-12-14 19:10:28 | Surprisingly, this joint serves the best Walnut Cakes i have ever tasted in my life..... It is a very old bakery.... The patties is also lip smacking....
Strongly recommend the Walnut Cake, try it once....But kindly refrain from taking your vehicle as parking is a serious pain..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Amrita Mondal | 36255179 | 4.0 | 2016-10-28 21:36:46 | The best bakery in town for traditional Christmas goodies like fruit cake, walnut cake, plain butter cake, plum cake, Brownies, tarts, etc. It is a place where bulk orders are taken generally. It is not a shop or a cafe. It is a bakery where you order stuff and take away. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tuks4 | 36484659 | 4.5 | 2016-10-25 00:29:07 | ive been an indirect customer of this bakery for a while.. my sis's school orders their items regularly and i get to taste them too :)
this time though, i went to the place & had my own order.. a good number of chicken & corn envelope & choc truffle cake, both eggless & w/ egg..

my 1 line verdict.. the BEST bakery in the city.. period. in terms of taste + price + raw materials + the care + the old-school process, this is without doubt the best place in Calcutta.. & i repeat CALCUTTA and not kolkatta or kolkutta or some other rubbish misnaming this city gets !
this is the place that makes proper patties, proper macrones, cakes & pastries.. almost all of their items taste uniquely clean & refined.. and someone with a decent palette, will feel the 'non-commercial' taste as well..

i had a client team visiting from Poland who were extremely happy eating these items..¬† chicken envelope is their costliest item @35 a pc.. v filling yet flaky & light.. the choc truffle cake melted away inside the mouth.. super soft !
ul see amul butter being used to fry the onions.. pure almond crumbs being used inside the cake's base.. egg whites been beaten for 30mins until those nice soft peaks show up.. no wonder the taste is superlative !

few downsides to mention.. the cheese puff is not good at all.. slice cakes are sometimes stiff.. the place can do better without being that cluttery.. someone with a nose for hygiene might not be thrilled with all the 'hands' being used.. but i guess that too is their USP at some point :) |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anushka Agarwal | 34748091 | 3.5 | 2016-10-24 11:21:12 | Been to this joint lately and loved their brownies and cakes. They are freshly baked and delicious both at the same time. Usually if you go to this place during late evening you'll miss out on most of the stuffs. Pre-ordering recommended. ‚úåüèªÔ∏è |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Debadyuti Karan | 5018051 | 4.0 | 2016-08-30 22:52:05 | Kolkata is full of sweet surprises. Who would ever guess that an old yellow house in central Kolkata houses one of the best bakeries in town?! A cake lovers paradise, this bakery is famous for its weddings cakes for the Anglo Indians. Good things don't come easy; one needs to make an effort to relish their creations. A pre order is a must at this 80 year old bakery. While most of their stuff is good, the must must must on the order list would be their almond cake, coconut macaroons and their soft moist dark brownies. If you are lucky and drop by you might find some' bakes' of the day that you could pick up. Debra Saldanha one of the daughters now runs the place and maintains the high quality standard set by her parents. The place is not a fancy store. They know their quality is far better than most bakeries in town and they let their baking do the talking. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Rajtilak Bhattacharjee | 68484 | 5.0 | 2016-08-20 22:28:12 | The best bakery in Kolkata. Must try their almond cakes, macaroons, and chocolate fudges. You can pre-order, although there is no home delivery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Indrajit Lahiri | 542545 | 4.5 | 2016-08-02 16:47:16 | There goes around a story in Kolkata gastronomic circuit that the best traditional l anglo-Indian cakes are found not in fancy hotels, but in few homes, and over the period of time, they‚Äôve become legends. Many have heard of the name, but few have actually been there, the name‚Äôs Saldanha Bakery and Confectionary

One should reach Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road (the tram road) and find out the B C Sen Jewellery shop on it. While in the afternoon, the traffic moves towards north, it comes on the right hand side. Take the adjacent lane and after 50-100 mtrs, you can find a yellow house on your left with Saldanha written on the outside wall. Parking is a big big problem. Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tisyaketu Sirkar | 3479861 | 5.0 | 2016-07-14 13:57:20 | This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Sumit Surai | 11641 | 4.0 | 2016-07-13 22:52:39 | This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Arjun Kumar Roy | 33434945 | 5.0 | 2016-05-18 00:48:34 | Its an amazing bakery where we get great some authentic baked products. Please try their cakes, mousses and other stuff... Its one the oldest in our city and serves you upto your expectations... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anwesha Ghosh | 14295941 | 3.5 | 2016-02-12 19:26:47 | One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Jude Martin | 1895578 | 4.0 | 2016-01-26 23:48:16 | Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Suhail Hassan | 684685 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 15:28:43 | Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items**** |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Koushik Paul | 16411585 | 4.5 | 2016-01-09 10:10:47 | What to say about this!! It is actually a hidden gem! One of my friend suggested this for Christmas cake shopping. It made us tired to find it out but cakes are actually superb!!! |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Oindrila Paul | 16152668 | 5.0 | 2016-01-08 00:38:34 | I will give 5 stars to this bakery because I've eaten here many a times and if has never let me down. Right from it's vegetarian items to the non vegetarian ones, and from the pastries to the cakes, Saldanha is pure bliss |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Madhurya Chaudhuri | 30816267 | 4.5 | 2016-01-06 21:09:10 | Awesome cakes,brownies,lemon drops and chicken patties . British cakes are the best. Assorted chocolates are good too. And everything comes in a very reasonable price. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Swarnendu Chandra | 32142557 | 5.0 | 2016-01-02 14:06:38 | I visited this place after reading a report in a local newspaper, and experience was mesmerizing. The walnut cake and fruit cake was simply delicious. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Souvik Sen | 9493051 | 4.5 | 2015-12-29 16:56:20 | Great Cakes I must say...This year I had their walnut & chocolate cakes in Christmas...Both was fabulous...Walnut was better...Price was INR 220/- per cake but considering the quality it really worth it..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Apple Orange | 31197595 | 5.0 | 2015-12-25 17:26:35 | I have never been to the shop but in our office every year during Christmas we get cakes from Saldanah Bakery and it is never enough...The Christmas cakes are simply what a first class cake should be...soft ...fresh and...the level sweetness is just right..love it every year and now it's  a ritual...will be visiting soon..üòäüòäüòä |

Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tisyaketu Sirkar | 3479861 | 5.0 | 2016-07-14 13:57:20 | This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Sumit Surai | 11641 | 4.0 | 2016-07-13 22:52:39 | This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Arjun Kumar Roy | 33434945 | 5.0 | 2016-05-18 00:48:34 | Its an amazing bakery where we get great some authentic baked products. Please try their cakes, mousses and other stuff... Its one the oldest in our city and serves you upto your expectations... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anwesha Ghosh | 14295941 | 3.5 | 2016-02-12 19:26:47 | One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Jude Martin | 1895578 | 4.0 | 2016-01-26 23:48:16 | Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Suhail Hassan | 684685 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 15:28:43 | Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items**** |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Koushik Paul | 16411585 | 4.5 | 2016-01-09 10:10:47 | What to say about this!! It is actually a hidden gem! One of my friend suggested this for Christmas cake shopping. It made us tired to find it out but cakes are actually superb!!! |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Oindrila Paul | 16152668 | 5.0 | 2016-01-08 00:38:34 | I will give 5 stars to this bakery because I've eaten here many a times and if has never let me down. Right from it's vegetarian items to the non vegetarian ones, and from the pastries to the cakes, Saldanha is pure bliss |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Madhurya Chaudhuri | 30816267 | 4.5 | 2016-01-06 21:09:10 | Awesome cakes,brownies,lemon drops and chicken patties . British cakes are the best. Assorted chocolates are good too. And everything comes in a very reasonable price. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Swarnendu Chandra | 32142557 | 5.0 | 2016-01-02 14:06:38 | I visited this place after reading a report in a local newspaper, and experience was mesmerizing. The walnut cake and fruit cake was simply delicious. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Souvik Sen | 9493051 | 4.5 | 2015-12-29 16:56:20 | Great Cakes I must say...This year I had their walnut & chocolate cakes in Christmas...Both was fabulous...Walnut was better...Price was INR 220/- per cake but considering the quality it really worth it..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Apple Orange | 31197595 | 5.0 | 2015-12-25 17:26:35 | I have never been to the shop but in our office every year during Christmas we get cakes from Saldanah Bakery and it is never enough...The Christmas cakes are simply what a first class cake should be...soft ...fresh and...the level sweetness is just right..love it every year and now it's  a ritual...will be visiting soon..üòäüòäüòä |

Strongly recommend the Walnut Cake, try it once....But kindly refrain from taking your vehicle as parking is a serious pain..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Amrita Mondal | 36255179 | 4.0 | 2016-10-28 21:36:46 | The best bakery in town for traditional Christmas goodies like fruit cake, walnut cake, plain butter cake, plum cake, Brownies, tarts, etc. It is a place where bulk orders are taken generally. It is not a shop or a cafe. It is a bakery where you order stuff and take away. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tuks4 | 36484659 | 4.5 | 2016-10-25 00:29:07 | ive been an indirect customer of this bakery for a while.. my sis's school orders their items regularly and i get to taste them too :)
this time though, i went to the place & had my own order.. a good number of chicken & corn envelope & choc truffle cake, both eggless & w/ egg..

my 1 line verdict.. the BEST bakery in the city.. period. in terms of taste + price + raw materials + the care + the old-school process, this is without doubt the best place in Calcutta.. & i repeat CALCUTTA and not kolkatta or kolkutta or some other rubbish misnaming this city gets !
this is the place that makes proper patties, proper macrones, cakes & pastries.. almost all of their items taste uniquely clean & refined.. and someone with a decent palette, will feel the 'non-commercial' taste as well..

i had a client team visiting from Poland who were extremely happy eating these items..¬† chicken envelope is their costliest item @35 a pc.. v filling yet flaky & light.. the choc truffle cake melted away inside the mouth.. super soft !
ul see amul butter being used to fry the onions.. pure almond crumbs being used inside the cake's base.. egg whites been beaten for 30mins until those nice soft peaks show up.. no wonder the taste is superlative !

few downsides to mention.. the cheese puff is not good at all.. slice cakes are sometimes stiff.. the place can do better without being that cluttery.. someone with a nose for hygiene might not be thrilled with all the 'hands' being used.. but i guess that too is their USP at some point :) |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anushka Agarwal | 34748091 | 3.5 | 2016-10-24 11:21:12 | Been to this joint lately and loved their brownies and cakes. They are freshly baked and delicious both at the same time.

Saldanha Bakery | Debadyuti Karan | 5018051 | 4.0 | 2016-08-30 22:52:05 | Kolkata is full of sweet surprises. Who would ever guess that an old yellow house in central Kolkata houses one of the best bakeries in town?! A cake lovers paradise, this bakery is famous for its weddings cakes for the Anglo Indians. Good things don't come easy; one needs to make an effort to relish their creations. A pre order is a must at this 80 year old bakery. While most of their stuff is good, the must must must on the order list would be their almond cake, coconut macaroons and their soft moist dark brownies. If you are lucky and drop by you might find some' bakes' of the day that you could pick up. Debra Saldanha one of the daughters now runs the place and maintains the high quality standard set by her parents. The place is not a fancy store. They know their quality is far better than most bakeries in town and they let their baking do the talking. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Rajtilak Bhattacharjee | 68484 | 5.0 | 2016-08-20 22:28:12 | The best bakery in Kolkata. Must try their almond cakes, macaroons, and chocolate fudges. You can pre-order, although there is no home delivery. |

The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tisyaketu Sirkar | 3479861 | 5.0 | 2016-07-14 13:57:20 | This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Sumit Surai | 11641 | 4.0 | 2016-07-13 22:52:39 | This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Arjun Kumar Roy | 33434945 | 5.0 | 2016-05-18 00:48:34 | Its an amazing bakery where we get great some authentic baked products. Please try their cakes, mousses and other stuff... Its one the oldest in our city and serves you upto your expectations... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anwesha Ghosh | 14295941 | 3.5 | 2016-02-12 19:26:47 | One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Jude Martin | 1895578 | 4.0 | 2016-01-26 23:48:16 | Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Suhail Hassan | 684685 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 15:28:43 | Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items**** |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Koushik Paul | 16411585 | 4.5 | 2016-01-09 10:10:47 | What to say about this!! It is actually a hidden gem! One of my friend suggested this for Christmas cake shopping. It made us tired to find it out but cakes are actually superb!!! |

Saldanha Bakery | Shaurya Pathak | 367302 | 4.0 | 2016-12-17 21:09:23 | It will be a time taking process to find this place. But it will test your resolve for the love of food.
Don't look around. Just look down and enjoy the lip smacking goodies. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Kashif Ahmed | 1115831 | 4.5 | 2016-12-14 19:10:28 | Surprisingly, this joint serves the best Walnut Cakes i have ever tasted in my life..... It is a very old bakery.... The patties is also lip smacking....
Strongly recommend the Walnut Cake, try it once....But kindly refrain from taking your vehicle as parking is a serious pain..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Amrita Mondal | 36255179 | 4.0 | 2016-10-28 21:36:46 | The best bakery in town for traditional Christmas goodies like fruit cake, walnut cake, plain butter cake, plum cake, Brownies, tarts, etc. It is a place where bulk orders are taken generally. It is not a shop or a cafe. It is a bakery where you order stuff and take away. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tuks4 | 36484659 | 4.5 | 2016-10-25 00:29:07 | ive been an indirect customer of this bakery for a while.. my sis's school orders their items regularly and i get to taste them too :)
this time though, i went to the place & had my own order.. a good number of chicken & corn envelope & choc truffle cake, both eggless & w/ egg..

my 1 line verdict.. the BEST bakery in the city.. period. in terms of taste + price + raw materials + the care + the old-school process, this is without doubt the best place in Calcutta.. & i repeat CALCUTTA and not kolkatta or kolkutta or some other rubbish misnaming this city gets !
this is the place that makes proper patties, proper macrones, cakes & pastries.. almost all of their items taste uniquely clean & refined.. and someone with a decent palette, will feel the 'non-commercial' taste as well..

i had a client team visiting from Poland who were extremely happy eating these items..¬† chicken envelope is their costliest item @35 a pc.. v filling yet flaky & light.. the choc truffle cake melted away inside the mouth.. super soft !
ul see amul butter being used to fry the onions.. pure almond crumbs being used inside the cake's base.. egg whites been beaten for 30mins until those nice soft peaks show up.. no wonder the taste is superlative !

few downsides to mention.. the cheese puff is not good at all.. slice cakes are sometimes stiff.. the place can do better without being that cluttery.. someone with a nose for hygiene might not be thrilled with all the 'hands' being used.. but i guess that too is their USP at some point :) |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anushka Agarwal | 34748091 | 3.5 | 2016-10-24 11:21:12 | Been to this joint lately and loved their brownies and cakes. They are freshly baked and delicious both at the same time. Usually if you go to this place during late evening you'll miss out on most of the stuffs. Pre-ordering recommended. ‚úåüèªÔ∏è |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Debadyuti Karan | 5018051 | 4.0 | 2016-08-30 22:52:05 | Kolkata is full of sweet surprises. Who would ever guess that an old yellow house in central Kolkata houses one of the best bakeries in town?! A cake lovers paradise, this bakery is famous for its weddings cakes for the Anglo Indians. Good things don't come easy; one needs to make an effort to relish their creations. A pre order is a must at this 80 year old bakery. While most of their stuff is good, the must must must on the order list would be their almond cake, coconut macaroons and their soft moist dark brownies. If you are lucky and drop by you might find some' bakes' of the day that you could pick up. Debra Saldanha one of the daughters now runs the place and maintains the high quality standard set by her parents. The place is not a fancy store. They know their quality is far better than most bakeries in town and they let their baking do the talking. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Rajtilak Bhattacharjee | 68484 | 5.0 | 2016-08-20 22:28:12 | The best bakery in Kolkata. Must try their almond cakes, macaroons, and chocolate fudges. You can pre-order, although there is no home delivery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Indrajit Lahiri | 542545 | 4.5 | 2016-08-02 16:47:16 | There goes around a story in Kolkata gastronomic circuit that the best traditional l anglo-Indian cakes are found not in fancy hotels, but in few homes, and over the period of time, they‚Äôve become legends. Many have heard of the name, but few have actually been there, the name‚Äôs Saldanha Bakery and Confectionary

One should reach Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road (the tram road) and find out the B C Sen Jewellery shop on it. While in the afternoon, the traffic moves towards north, it comes on the right hand side. Take the adjacent lane and after 50-100 mtrs, you can find a yellow house on your left with Saldanha written on the outside wall. Parking is a big big problem. Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

One should reach Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road (the tram road) and find out the B C Sen Jewellery shop on it. While in the afternoon, the traffic moves towards north, it comes on the right hand side. Take the adjacent lane and after 50-100 mtrs, you can find a yellow house on your left with Saldanha written on the outside wall. Parking is a big big problem. Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tisyaketu Sirkar | 3479861 | 5.0 | 2016-07-14 13:57:20 | This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Sumit Surai | 11641 | 4.0 | 2016-07-13 22:52:39 | This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Arjun Kumar Roy | 33434945 | 5.0 | 2016-05-18 00:48:34 | Its an amazing bakery where we get great some authentic baked products. Please try their cakes, mousses and other stuff... Its one the oldest in our city and serves you upto your expectations... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anwesha Ghosh | 14295941 | 3.5 | 2016-02-12 19:26:47 | One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Jude Martin | 1895578 | 4.0 | 2016-01-26 23:48:16 | Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Suhail Hassan | 684685 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 15:28:43 | Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items**** |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Koushik Paul | 16411585 | 4.5 | 2016-01-09 10:10:47 | What to say about this!! It is actually a hidden gem! One of my friend suggested this for Christmas cake shopping. It made us tired to find it out but cakes are actually superb!!! |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Oindrila Paul | 16152668 | 5.0 | 2016-01-08 00:38:34 | I will give 5 stars to this bakery because I've eaten here many a times and if has never let me down. Right from it's vegetarian items to the non vegetarian ones, and from the pastries to the cakes, Saldanha is pure bliss |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Madhurya Chaudhuri | 30816267 | 4.5 | 2016-01-06 21:09:10 | Awesome cakes,brownies,lemon drops and chicken patties . British cakes are the best. Assorted chocolates are good too. And everything comes in a very reasonable price. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Swarnendu Chandra | 32142557 | 5.0 | 2016-01-02 14:06:38 | I visited this place after reading a report in a local newspaper, and experience was mesmerizing. The walnut cake and fruit cake was simply delicious. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Souvik Sen | 9493051 | 4.5 | 2015-12-29 16:56:20 | Great Cakes I must say...This year I had their walnut & chocolate cakes in Christmas...Both was fabulous...Walnut was better...Price was INR 220/- per cake but considering the quality it really worth it..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Apple Orange | 31197595 | 5.0 | 2015-12-25 17:26:35 | I have never been to the shop but in our office every year during Christmas we get cakes from Saldanah Bakery and it is never enough...The Christmas cakes are simply what a first class cake should be...soft ...fresh and...the level sweetness is just right..love it every year and now it's  a ritual...will be visiting soon..üòäüòäüòä |

Kafe 6/2B | Piko Biswas | None | 410422 | 4.0 | 2015-11-22 11:11:50 | This place is really close to my house, and I popped over with my mom one day to try out some cold stuff. It's a small cozy place, with really sweet quaint decor, flowers, and soft pretty colours, and plentiful lighting, and pretty picture windows. Being really small, it ensured personal attention from the lady who helped us select our food. We had a Tutti Frutti ice cream sundae, and a cold coffee. Service was pretty fast and both tasted really good. The prices are pretty affordable, considering the great quality of the stuff we tasted. I'll definitely go back for more. It's perfect for an evening outing with a few friends, or as a me-time excursion. A plus point is the huge range of Paperboat products they have! |

Desi Lane | Pooja Agarwal | None | 329057 | 4.0 | 2016-12-09 14:48:40 | Okay.. So desi lane is easily located and has replaced food bazar in alipore.  Peppy ambience with very thoughtful interiors. It has seperate sections ..u enter like a bollywood star.  Look around and feel like I have entered a bollywood setup . Rocking interiors however it needs complimenting music too. 
The waiters are very enthusiastic to serve you.. So the service is pretty good. (They need to take a break as the customers need their privacy to talk too!!) 

Coming to the food.. Its value for money . I had oan fried noodles and a pina colada.. Decent.  :-) it's on my next visit list to try more of the space . |

Desi Lane | Poulami Prasad | None | 16328041 | 4.5 | 2016-12-05 09:58:22 | Just wow!! Yesterday night went 4 a bday party!! Grt ambience food was also good, satisfied service and a very nice place to hangout with friends.. The hookah was served with a bad coal though but they quickly replaced it and the chicken drumsticks was too spicy..  but the dance floor and the ambience was  attractive.. Thanks for a good time! ! |
 
Desi Lane | Vasuki Jasani | None | 34767270 | 5.0 | 2016-12-01 09:39:59 | We planned on having my parent's 25th wedding anniversary here and it was the best decision we made.
Ambience of this place just justifies its name and every bit of it has a desi touch. It gave a very cozy or rather comfortable feeling.
Drinks served to us were perfectly made and d starters were served absolutely hot.
This place has amazng props to click pictures with and the look of the entrance is gorgeous.....totally a picture taking zone!!!
Most importantly the food was delicious, the dal makhani, punjabi aloo and biryani is a must try here. |

Complete paisa wasool.....i got so many thank u messages from my friends saying that they never had such rocking party. Great party, great DJ, excellent service, the staffs were there till 2.30 am without a sign of frustration on their faces rather they were so very helpful. One of my friend was little high & puked. I wl never forget the service the manager gave to my friend. 
Thank u Desi Lane....I m really touched |

The ambience is simply something one has never experienced in Kolkata before. It is just like a local street with barber shops type themes, movie posters, khatiyas¬†(beds) as sitting places, etc etc... What's more is there's an Autorickshaw and a typical Bajaj scooter inside the place to excite all... The nostalgic movie posters from the golden era of Hindi ¬†cinema, the witty phrases all around will amuse you... It's like a walk down the memory lane of the old times before modernization of India.¬†

Additionally, there are games that one can play like the foosball, darts, spin a wheel, dice etc.

Wide choice of food and drinks with a variety of cocktails and mocktails will surely delight your taste buds. It's a fun place to be for sure and definitely a place one should visit with family and friends alike. Wouldn't like to spoil the fun by saying all that I found interesting there... So do visit this place if you get a chance...¬†One thing is for certain, if anyone visits Desi Lane, he or she is bound to return... for its one place you can never forget.

Keep up the good work Team Desi Lane!!! |

Desi Lane | Sohini Sarkar | None | 33862921 | 3.5 | 2016-10-19 22:51:46 | Bring that color back in your dull looking life with colorful and tasty food in Desi Lane.

Welcoming you from the lanes of Alipore are multitudes of rainbow colored bulbs, old Bollywood posters and even a cute, yellow scooter.

Located on the posh street of Burdwan Road, Alipore, this place falls right after the SBI building.

Prettily decorated place, with spot clean tables, the restaurant cum lounge bar is divided into two settings. While the immediate entrance of the place leads you to their moderately large sized restaurant hall, the hookah lounge is located behind a cushioned closed door.

The lounge room has a large screen TV. They make their shisha good. Hitting the strong flavours are paan salsa, paan rasna while grape is noticeably a mild flavor. 

Their Chili Cheese Toast is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. This maybe a bit of extra enthusiasm for a piece of toast, but it deserves all of it. Crispy base with gooey cheese on top. And that is not all, the flavor is off the roof. A five out of five for this item.

Although this place deserves a five, there are somethings that disappointed me as a customer massively. The service here is bad.

I had ordered cheese sandwich for myself, but our waiter had misunderstood it to be toasts. The toasts as stated earlier were excellent. No complaints regarding that. However, the miscommunication led to a bill that was way too much.

Although it was later taken care of by the staff team, this sort of mistakes really does ruin a customer's experience on a huge scale.

The food here is excellent. So is the decor and the ambiance, hence the 3.5

I'll be coming back here because the food I believe deserves more than what I rated. One of your hidden gems in Alipore. Drop by and be amazed. |
 
Desi Lane | AkritiPoddar | None | 16125324 | 4.0 | 2016-10-17 14:04:28 | Amazingly themed and offers a great ambience. The quirky posters and the Desi khatiya were well thought of. Could be visited with both family and friends as the place hosts family crowds as well. The Service is very quick and they ensure all guests have a good time.
Do check out the Chinese dishes if you're looking for something spicy and crisp. 
Desi Lane surely lives up to it's name by creating the most suitable environment for Desi lovers. |

Desi Lane | Surolia | None | 898402 | 5.0 | 2016-10-06 15:03:21 | Been to Desi Lane. Had vegetarian food over there without onion and garlic. I can say that no other restaurant can offer such delicious good without onion & garlic.
Hariyali Daal, Desi Videshi mixed veg and Fried Ice Cream are signature dishes which one can relish over there. |
 
Desi Lane | Ankita Patni | None | 3072545 | 4.5 | 2016-10-04 00:19:09 | One word for desi Lane ' WoW' . everything is so good about the place. Food, staffs , music , ambience , vibes . loved it to the core. Amazing ambience.  You feel so positive and happy here. Nice food. Must visit . |
 
Desi Lane | Swati Singhania | None | 1793405 | 5.0 | 2016-10-01 19:52:00 | I have been to this few times by now, and every time I step in the place..its always brimming with life. The food here is awesome.  I have tried their North indian food, Chinese and also few of the Italian dishes. All of them very relished by my taste buds.  But the best thing about the restaurant is that it has carved out a space for all. A separate section for family groups and parallely a separate section when you are dining with your friends. 
You can walk into the place and let the balance be taken care by their courteous team. Seems I have found another favorite joint! |

Desi Lane | Pamela Nandi | None | 2821382 | 4.0 | 2016-09-29 21:04:20 | Located on the first floor of the bldg The Enclave at the Alipore StateBank crossing - perfect adda placeto chill out with friends in desi style. Visited one sunday evening - the place is over crowded and noisy. But the highway like¬† theme with roadside low seaters and the bar - Desi Theeka will attract every guest to visit this place again and again. There are private dinning areas for family who would prefer to enjoy food away from the crowd and noise. Nothing new in the menu, but the food was good - butter lemon fish. In terms of service and hospitality, this eatery is a bit messy. Looks like they are still not yet well settled to serve the guests. |
 
Desi Lane | Sweta Agarwal | None | 36152816 | 5.0 | 2016-09-28 15:00:42 | A newly opened Resto bar in Alipore, the place is a must visit whether you planning a casual dine out with friends, family time over food, Night out with music and drinks or a private party for your group. The theme - totally desi with the right combination of quirkiness, adores the walls and indoors and the food - perfect for every taste and cuisine. Don't forget to get yourself clicked at the photo booth, on the scooter or inside the auto. Options galore, Desi Lane rocks.. |

Looks expensive but reasonable enough to plane for a date or a family dinner.
Thumps up for this place! !!!!!!!!!! |
 
Desi Lane | Gaurav Vyas | None | 31237453 | 5.0 | 2016-09-27 13:51:22 | We had the best Chinese food the other night at desi lane.

Desi Lane | Aakriti | None | 35147778 | 5.0 | 2016-09-19 14:12:06 | Awesome ambience and good food. This new restaurant houses a lounge, a separate hookah room , a karaoke room and the main floor. Quirky paintings and pictures adorn the walls with a great and colourful entry giving you the ultimate North Indian feel. They did a good job with the food as well. A must try |
 
Desi Lane | Deepshikha Saraf | None | 258224 | 2.5 | 2016-09-18 18:18:42 | The restaurant opened right next to my place. Had been planning to visit for a long while, ever since the soft launch. 
The ambience is okay. Desi lane doesn't match with the feel. The old posters is the only design feel. The chairs are so high! Almost like a bar. And the sofa are so low. The distance between the table and the sofa is so much that u have to shift aage and bend over to eat!!! 

The food is a major let down. We were two of us. So we order cheese kurkure kebab as starters- it was  bland. The roti covering was to thick. And the filling was bland. All u could taste was cheese. No seasoning, nothing. 

Then we ordered for a hariyali sabji moti and a lachcha paratha. The sabji was horrible 
üôàüôàüôà semi raw veggies, bland taste. 

The roti though was crisp and thin. |
 
Desi Lane | Avantika Agarwal | None | 35835337 | 4.5 | 2016-09-16 11:32:11 | Desi Lane offers an ultimate desi experience, With delicious food and desi decor, it is definitely worth a try. To add to it, It has a very convenient location.¬†

This desi restaurant is every foodie's delight and it offers a large variety of cuisines. ¬†The ambience is very desi and different¬†with khatiyas and autos. We ordered crackling spinach, spaghetti¬†nepolitan,¬† risotto and pizza which tasted very good. We also ordered hookah which was very smooth. ¬†

The staff was very friendly. I strongly recommend this place. |
 
Desi Lane | Ankita Sharma | None | 35907184 | 5.0 | 2016-09-16 11:26:02 | It is one of my favourites in Kolkata.

Desi Lane | Sneha Bhowmick | None | 35906810 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 17:26:54 | Newly opened with outstanding ambience and DJ on the dance floor. The food was also really great. The main sitting area houses some cool ‚ÄòCharpai‚Äô, as one may see on the roadside Dhabas. The Charpai section has been divided into separate halves, with each of these halves, displaying a unique theme of its own.¬† However it's worth a visit. |

Desi Lane | Hari Sharma | None | 35949145 | 5.0 | 2016-09-12 13:06:42 | Went on a Sunday. It was chocobloc. Still preferred to wait for almost 35 - 40 mins. Have no idea how almost 40 minutes passed. I Was just looking at the amazing interiors & my wife & son were busy taking selfies. So courteous staffs that even after being over occupied due to heavy rush they served us water & offered a fresh lime to my son free of cost...100 rupee worth of free fresh lime is not a big deal but its difficult to see this kind of a personal touch & respect for guests ...most restaurants don't even allow to stand in the restaurant area when they are full.  Food quality was equaly good & worth the wait. As far as the food quality is concerned would rate it amont the top 3 in kolkata. Will recommend a must must visit for this place. Completely in love with this place. |

Desi Lane | Megha | None | 1936800 | 1.0 | 2016-09-11 20:12:58 | Placed an order for a chicken steak and a chicken tikka masala kabab for home delivery. After 20 mins of placing the order I got a call from them saying that the steak was not available. I went ahead with the kabab order. 
The kabab was absolutely chewy and unedible!! The mint chutney served with it was watery. I don't think that I would want to order again. Paid 450 bucks for this. What a waste of money!!! |

The only problem I found was the noise coming from the lounge everytime the door opens , that's too loud for the people sitting inside. |

The food was awesome, the energy of the team of Desi lane was such that they were eager to give us a great experience. Loved every moment. Thank you desi lane for making our evening memorable. |

Desi Lane | Juhi Ramakant | None | 34669926 | 1.0 | 2016-08-20 17:26:51 | First of all its got no signage at ground level making it tough to locate
when you reach the first floor, it looks like under construction because of the outside
seating is not really comfortable and the place is too too bright that it hurts the eye
the food is below average and there is a massive room for improvment
the service is quick which is the only thing i liked about the place |
 
Desi Lane | Sudipta Majumdar | None | 843646 | 4.5 | 2016-08-19 22:08:23 | Curious me dropped in Desi Lane on the very first week of its opening and I was clearly bowled out by the vibrant ambience.Located in plush Alipore, this themed den can be best described as a place that encourages one to unwind with good friends. This week I returned to celebrate my birthday with a whole bunch of pals, and my guests had a rolling time. The in-house Dj sure knows how to keep you on the dance floor. The selfie wall is to die for, and the food was just the perfect accompaniment. Having our slurp of tom kha gai or the lip-smacking Desi Lane special meatballs would be remembered for long. A space buzzing with desi vibes, the place surely created a whole new experience for us friends.  Thank you Desi Lane for making my birthday celebration an affair to cherish. |

The ambiance is superb and the place is amazing in so many ways. This place really took me on a nostalgic trip with its interiors. Food and Drinks: Well, this part was really amazing. Starters were a lovely affair. I started off with
with ‚ÄúShajani Murgh Bahar‚Äù and my veggie friend‚Äôs favorite ‚ÄúGolden Baby corn with Spinach Sauce‚Äù both was delicious! 
The main course was the next best thing to arrive on our table. 
Mutton Rara Ghost .. you should not miss this one , its best in the town . Mutton is soft to the core with one Kabli Naan . On the other hand my friend was moved with ‚Äú Benarashi Dum alu and ‚Äú Lacheder paratha..

Coming to the desserts, we ordered ‚ÄúMalpuya with Rabri . never tried this combination but definitely would have missed if not tried .

Service:The service here is superb. The staff is courteous and is always on their toes to assist you with everything. They serve with smile and I am definitely coming back here :) |

An Idea | Subhannita Guha | None | 34592825 | 3.0 | 2016-07-10 22:21:22 | This place is moderately well decorated. The furnitures don't match. Ambience-wise, it's very boring. We were the only customers on the ground floor.

SERVICE: Now, whatever I tried to order, they had served the customers just before us and was not available anymore. I was so angry, we only ordered 2 dishes instead of 4.
After waiting for like 30-40 minutes only the burger arrived. Then another 15 minutes for our Caf√© Frappe after we finished our burger!

I LIKED THEIR: Chicken Burger with Mayo Coriander Dip. It was really good. It was more like an Indian Burger with no cheese but masala and chutney and very little mayonnaise. The buns were crunchy on the outside and soft from inside. Surprisingly, they had put capsicum in the burger (and I HATE capsicum) and it went well with the Indian style. The Caf√© Frappe (we had actually ordered cold coffee but then they said we have to order Caf√© Frappe as that's what it is but had still put both of them in as different options with different prices) was good.

I DIDN'T LIKE THEIR: We only ordered these two (as they seemed out of everything we asked) and luckily liked both of them. |

An Idea | Suraj Agarwal | None | 31257225 | 1.0 | 2016-06-11 08:29:20 | Not a good place to be to . The interiors are very boring . The restaurant is also inadequately staffed . We saw a person coming to take order after a long time . Hookah there chokes like anything . Most of the times the staff are busy among themselves . Food is basically amateur cooking . Just ok for a cup of coffee . Avoid otherwise . |
 
An Idea | Murtaza Khambaty | None | 4347171 | 3.0 | 2016-05-28 14:20:49 | Located off Circus Avenue opposite Haji Saheb.

Planned to visit this new place on a Sunday evening. They had promoted themselves on Groupon, now nearbuy, so we had a voucher.

The place is well designed utilising the space available. Well themed to have creative discussions etc. A new concept truly. But the staircase leading to the mezzanine does not go proportionate to the height. I probably bumped twice, bruising my head.

Here comes the worst part.¬†
The manager, not trained at all. Complains started that he cannot honour the deal and the deal with groupon is not fixed and blah blah. He ended up honouring it.
Nearly 70% of the items were unavailable. So we had to be content with what was available. Even in the mocktails a few of them were unavailable. So we ordered from the menu, drinks which were far more expensive. Because of lack of training he ended up accepting the order.
Ordered French fries, Idea special burger, Chicken Sandwich, 2 Oreo shakes (part of the deal worth 300)
And from the menu ordered Idea special pizza as a replacement for an item not available.
Pizza was horrendous. Other items were okay.
And in total i probably had to wait 2 hours for the full order to arrive. Lack of staff and chef it seemed.

The manager ended up by giving me a bill of only Rs.100.
We thought of correcting him, but with the horrible experience, we did not think of paying any extra.¬†
Feel sorry for the owner. |
 
An Idea | Mukulita Ganguly | None | 207896 | 3.5 | 2016-05-14 16:08:23 | 'An Idea' struck us one Sunday evening when we were searching for a nice cafe to drop in. The place is nicely done up, making good use of the space across two floors. It does look like a typical hookah parlour and their choice of loud party music further accentuates the vibe. We were their only customers that evening, and duly chose a couch on the first floor. The woman who came to take our orders informed us that none of the iced teas that we wanted were available, much to our dismay. We finally settled for a Green Apple Lemonade and an Egg Fried Burger. 
The food was served within 15 minutes. The lemonade was a tad bit stronger in flavor than we had wanted but it was refreshing. What stole my heart and changed my feelings regarding that place was the egg burger. Trapped between the mayo slathered burger buns were a patty of potato, a nicely fried egg placed sunny side up, a slice of cheese, onions, tomatoes and slices of cucumber. It was extremely juicy and yummy. The best part was the perfectly done fries. They were hot, crispy and came with some masala sprinkled on top. Together with the ketchup dip, the dish spelled so much comfort. 
I hope the cafe owner makes it a point not to keep half of their menu items unavailable or out of stock and this surely would turn out to be a better place. |

An Idea is the newest addition to the list of upcoming caf√©s in Kolkata but, isn't yet another herd-walker. This caf√©, as the name subtly suggests, is all about coming up with something new. An Idea walks in as an all new corporate caf√© wherein one could peacefully discuss business over a refreshing beverage or some delicious snacks!
Spread across two levels, the ground and the mezzanine, the AMBIANCE spells of a positive vibe and does lift up the mood and aid relaxation. The pristine white walls & ceiling, with business-oriented quotes across, need regular maintenance so as to not send across a negative first. The combination of cushioned as well as leather upholstered seating which could seat around thirty heads added as a plus.
The ventilation needs to be worked upon and the music volumes could be kept low as the loud levels might end up disturbing a corporate discussion. A routine mopping would help upkeep the place. Happened to visit this place for the first time on an Invitation for Food Audit and thereafter have visited it a couple of times.

Coming to the FOOD, the menu on offer was widespread and looked promising enough with a plus of included non-vegetarian fare. But, the dessert options need to be increased. The following was sampled across all visits:

- Blueberry Lemonade
Bottled blueberry crush proportionately used with a well-prepared lemonade. The blueberry flavor was found to be subtle. Could have been a notch higher to give the drink a nice texture & a better taste.

- Pineapple Soda
The drink was just about average and lacked the spot on fizziness. The fruit flavor was found to be too low and the soda had minimal fizz. Has a scope of improvement.

- Caf√© Frapp√©
Frapp√© is a Greek foam-covered iced coffee drink made from brewed coffee.¬† Was well-prepared and had a nice & strong aftertaste of brewed coffee. Served with a dollop of ice-cream on top added as a plus. However, a frozen scoop of ice-cream & a quenelle of whipped cream would have lifted up the level of presentation. Nevertheless, the beverage did taste good.

- Green Apple Lemonade
This drink proved to be a hero throughout. A perfect balance between the flavored crush & lemon juice was struck every time it was ordered. Yes, there were repeat orders. Perfectly done lemonade with the right amount of green apple crush. Tasted refreshing! Highly recommended.
The umbrella straw could be swapped with a lemon wedge for a formal presentation.

- Mix Berry Shake
This drink was a disappointment, mainly because of its disproportionate punch of flavors. The mix of the assortment of berries (read: flavored syrups/crush) failed as the proportion wasn't looked upon. Has a huge scope of improvement. A striking of perfect balance & usage of fresh berries (raspberries, strawberries & blueberries) instead would do wonders. Adding a banana & a well set vanilla-flavored ice-cream to the beverage would take the flavor a notch up.

- Mango Smoothie
A nicely prepared smoothie with low-fat yoghurt, toned milk, flavored syrup & chopped frozen fruit always tastes nice. However, the thick consistency of the beverage was difficult to sip on due to the narrow-mouth straw. A broad-mouth could be better bet. Nevertheless, the beverage impressed. The frozen fruit/coarse crush could be substituted by a ripe fruit in season.

- Blue Lagoon
The drink had a nice balance of Blue curacao syrup, lime & soda. Was extremely refreshing!
Recommended.

- Spicy Mojito
A twist to a virgin mojito was to have the mint leaves swapped with crushed green chillies. The swap was an instat hit and the mojito tasted awesome. Fizzy enough to satiate the bases and spicy enough to leave a nice aftertaste.

- Cold Coffee with Icecream
Failed to live up to the expectation. The coffee flavor was found to be flat and needed to be a tad stronger. Nevertheless, the blend of milk, coffee, ice-cream and sugar was fine. The consistency of the drink could be thicker than served.
The drink as a whole could be improved a lot.

- Hot Chocolate
The mahine-made beverages do taste good but, fail to produce consistency throughout. The drink was thick & extremely chocolatey till the three-fourth portion of the cup. Thereafter, the chocolatey flavor diluted and the drink was too dilute for the liking.
However, a hand-made hot chocolate would always prove to be better! R&D could be done for the betterment of the drink.

- Masala French Fries
Crisp, seasoned & slightly greasy fries served along with ketchup. Was just about average to taste.

- Veg burger
A flavorful, slightly oily & crisp Aloo (Potato) Patty sandwiched along with fresh slices of tomatoes, cucumber, onion & iceberg lettuce inside a mayo-spread burger bun tasted delicious. However, the shape of the bun could have been maintained and the spread of the mayo be restricted to the inside of the bun (and, not to the sides as well).

- Veg Sandwich
Fresh cold cuts (tomatoes, onion & cucumber) sandwiched between two slices of bread along with perfect seasoning were grilled to crispness. Delicious to taste. Was accompanied by ketchup & mayonnaise as dips.

- Idea Special Veg Pizza
The pizza was a bit of disappointment as the base sauce lacked flavors. As a result, the pizza tasted flat. However, the toppings of assorted Olives, American Corn, Pineapple & Capsicum were found to be fresh. The pizza was nicely baked with a generous amount of cheese on top but, the lack of punch in the base sauce couldn't be made up for. Has scope of improvement.

- Veg Mixed Sauce Pasta
Slightly under-boiled pasta (penne) tossed in an imbalance of Arrabbiata & Becham√©l Sauce made up the dish. Due to the imbalance, the rose pink color of the Primavera (mixed) sauce was missed. The Arrabbiata sauce lacked the tanginess it should have, resulting in the overpowering of the creamy texture of the Bechamel sauce making the dish too cheesy for the liking. The pasta as a whole was slightly under-seasoned and was found to have a decent scope of improvement.

- Brownie with Ice-cream
The dessert failed to impress. The plain brownies were stiff, cold & too sweet. Replacing the plain ones for the walnut ones and serving them hot would help re-create this dish in a much better manner. The ice-cream served on top of the brownie was a melted form of a quenelle. Serving it either as a scoop or as a quenelle wouldn't affect much till the time the ice-cream is frozen.
Presented with a generous drizzle of chocolate sauce was nice but, a warmer drizzle would have been much appreciated. Hope the dish is worked upon and the ending is a happy one. 

‚Ä¢ The SHEESHA was found to be smoky and lasted long.

The STAFF conduct was found to be polite and friendly. A shoutout to Asif who catered the customers in the best possible way! Looking at the bigger frame, the staff needs training and also needs to be more welcoming.
The SERVICE is somewhat slow and needs to be worked upon.

The PRICES were found to be inclined towards a reasonable end.

Overall, the experience was nice. 
- Being a new startup, one needs time to settle. This place has a great scope and can do much better in the coming days!
Hope to see An 'improved' Idea soon. |
 
An Idea | Adil Faiz | None | 30736151 | 3.0 | 2016-03-12 18:13:47 | Finding this cafe is very easy because its exactly the opposite of Haji Saheb restaurant  in Park Circus Area...But entering the cafe is a bit tricky somewhat :p.... You need to cross all the muds and stones lying just near the entrance carefully as the KMC work is in progress.... 

Anyways coming back to the cafe, the place looks nice and filled with frames, paintings, etc... The walls are written with quotes... Staffs working here are polite and attentive.... Ground floor is spacious with sofas and chairs... They have a big projector and the best thing about this is you can connect the projector with your mobile phone and when doing  anything on your phone, it displays onto the projector...one can tease his/her friend's by saying "tu mera yeh kaam karde warna tera secret or embarassng photos/videos ko projector mai dikha denge abhi" :p fir kya bechare ko manna hi padega...

For a sports lover like me, my adda is always the first floor because its more comfortable watching the match like being on the balcony of a theatre :D 

V asked for one HOOKAH Pan Thunder flavor.. (hookah was okaay typs)... 

V had their own recipe An idea VEG PIZZA...(pizza was very delicious and well cooked... It was filled with cheese.. The cheese were rolling down on my lips while eating....i loved it... Many people doesn't bother about what  quality tomato sauce its being served with.... But sauce plays a very important role in the taste of pizza, burgers and all in your mouth.... An idea serves the best sauce along with pizza)..

V also had BROWNIE served with vanilla ice cream and dipped in chocolate sauce... ( brownies were a little on the harder side while cutting but the ice cream and chocolate sauce together makes it a perfect taste into the mouth no doubt.... Its nice... 

Lastly v had LEMON ICE TEA..... The taste was just so good.... Everything was well mixed to the right proportion... 

AN IDEA is definitely a nice and suitable spot for sports lover in a pocket friendly way...! |
 
An Idea | Liril Sharma | None | 31697087 | 1.5 | 2016-03-09 10:48:55 | Starting with the bags n loads f garbage which is almost near its entrance will make u feel so not good!!Next coming to the place itself.... the first impression u get will b good only coz the interiors is nt so bad.Inspiration quotes on walls are always good. Coming to the food!Disgusting in one word. Although its nt good to tag so harsh words but really wish could hve helped. Ask food ask drinks all the same and not that its vei much on the economical side,quite standard price and below average stuffs. |
 
An Idea | Avinash Arora | None | 8186961 | 4.5 | 2016-03-09 09:22:30 | Nice cafe. An entrepreneur kind of environment. Cafe is specially dedicated to start ups and entrepreneurs. However, anyone can spend and have a nice time with theirs friends with coffee at reasonable price. I liked the place. |
 
An Idea | Pawan Jaiswal/The Food Crave | None | 73744 | 4.0 | 2016-03-06 13:19:52 | LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION:

3rd visit from Panch Phoron

Filled with restaurants, cafes and fast food joints in the Park street and Park circus area where former places have done well and set them up and new openings are working hard to provide quality and survive.
¬†This newly opened cafe is located at the park circus area just opposite of Haji Saheb and Arsalan near Beck Bagan. Dealing with some fantastic foods and drinks items, they really provide some quality for your taste buds as well as hukkah is also available. Construction is in progress from KMC so it will be difficult for you to get in and walk comfortably.
This was an invitation from the cafe owner itself to our Panch Phoron group for the food tasting purpose.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE:
From the main gate you start to get some positive vibes in you. As you walk in you'll find the place to be big and spacious. Approx sitting of 60-70 people. It has two sitting areas one on the ground which was on the cozy side and another upper gallery which was more nicer and colorful too. Interiors are very eye catchy. Walls and ceiling has wallpapers with different places, people and quotes. Lots of paintings and photo frames has been displayed too. Sitting arrangement is quite decent with comfortable chairs and sofas. Lightnings are quite good. Run in complete air conditioned as well as there is a big projector screen above the main gate. They also got music system installed for your entertainment and better experience, Service is very prompt ¬†and fast. The place is very well managed by Asif (if i remember the name properly). the staffs were sound and very attentive.

FOODS AND DRINKS:
We walked in and took our seats and waiting for the beginning. The menu was quite set before so we were ready for some surprises. We were first greeted with some fine and very well made drinks in forms of Mango Smoothie, Blue Lagoon, Ice Frappe, Green apple, Masala Lemonade and hot Chocolate.
Mango smoothie was very good. It was thick mixed with ice and taste remembered me of eating raw mango. The flavor of mango can be felt in each and every sip thou i found a bit difficult to drag the drink from the straw.
Blue lagoon was very refreshing on the other hand. It was tasting hard and perfect. Few slices of lemon was added in the drink to give a lemon flavor as well.
Green apple was just outstanding. The best drink according to the group for the evening comparing to all the other we had. The flavor make you feel good in each and every sip you take.
Ice frappe looked appealing with the ice scoop over it but it disappointed at the end. it was very thin and taste was absent. Could have been much better.
Hot chocolate looked very good with the choco sauce over it. It was hot and taste was done justice.
Masala lemonade didn't disappoint ¬†as well. Not the best one i would say but was clearly satisfied with the taste and flavor of the drink.

Later we moved on the food items in forms of Egg fried Burger, Veg burger, Chicken sauce burger, Chicken burger, Sunny side chicken club sandwich, veg sandwich, chicken pizza, crispy chilli chicken and mixed sauce pasta.

The description of each and every burger as well as sandwich could be explained in simply one word that is "BRILLIANT".
From the egg burger which consisted of potato, cheese, poached egg with mayonese and lettuce between the bread.
To veg burger which has the stuffed with chicken , cheese, lettuce, cucumber and salty in taste.
Chicken burger burger was good too. The chicken between the bread was made well as well as crunchy,
Sunny side chicken club sandwich had two stuffing with three layers served with mayonnaise, tomato, ketup another was with chicken whereas the third with egg which was simply awesome.
Veg sandwich was made with onions, tomatoes and cucumber. Taste was also decent enough.
Chicken Tandoori pizza was good but was a bit average. The bread was not upto the mark and taste of chicken ¬†in it was too average.
An idea special veg pizza was good topped with corns, capsicum, black olives. thou the bread and the crust was bit satisfactory here,
Crispy chilly chicken was crispy, but the chicken was a bit hard, had to chew hard and more the tomato ketup flavor was coming in my mouth.
Mixed sauce pasta was good till it was served hot and eaten at the same time. the penne was not boiled well so was the complaint from all. The sauces were bit scrambled with the white sauce taking the control of the pasta flavor. Still was good in taste but can be even better.

QNQ AND PRICES:
Quality was very decent and quality was satisfactory too. the chef kept the things intact while making each and every item. Thou some things went wrong but still it can be ignored. Prices are pinched well.

CONCLUSION:
With these kind of burgers and drinks they really impressed me big time. I believe everybody who visit there will be loving the place with their awesome food and fine hospitality. I wish them luck for future and hope them do well in future.

NOTE: this review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place. |
 
An Idea | Snehasis | None | 1142256 | 4.0 | 2016-03-04 19:56:45 | [Intro]

An Idea | Subham Ghosh | None | 2987484 | 4.0 | 2016-03-03 00:53:53 | That horrible situation of being stuck at Park Circus with friends, with the only option to hang out being the very family friendly Biriyani-Mughlai restaurants, now has a solution, which is An Idea. This lovely caf√© has newly opened , just opposite to Haji Saheb, near Meher Ali Road crossing, away from the hustle and bustle of the Park Circus Traffic.

I was invited here with Team Panchphoron for a food tasting session. An Idea is quite spacious, and spread over two floors. While both the floors are well decorated with multicolored posters and photo frames with inspiring quotes, it is the first floor which sort of gives a more cosy feel , and is more suitable for romantic dine out. The seats are cushioned and comfortable. We got seated in the ground floor. I liked the idea of placing the seats at a good distance from one another which will not hamper the privacy of the customers. Also, it was good to find that the cafe hasn't made the most out of its space and has focused mainly on the comfort of its customers.

We were served with gum flavoured hookah which I didn‚Äôt have, but my fellow foodies loved it.

Since it is a caf√©, we sampled a wide range of mocktails:

1.	Blue Lagoon ‚Äì This was a really refreshing drink. Made on soda base, it was slightly frothy and citrus in flavour, with a kick of lime.

2.	Mango Smoothie ‚Äì Even though this drink was made out of rich Mango Puree mixed with milk, it wasn‚Äôt too sweet, just the way I like it. However, the ice cubes weren‚Äôt crushed properly when mixed to the drink, making the texture coarse, and difficult to sip with a straw or otherwise.

3.	Green Apple Lemonade ‚Äì My favourite among all the mocktails here, the subtle green apple essence gave the drink a new dimension. This is a perfect drink for a summertime hangout.

4.	Ice Frappe - The drink was slightly watery and tasted average. Also, the vanilla ice cream topping wasn't a proper scoop. So, it was poor in terms of presentation too.

5.	Masala Lemonade - The masala lemonade was also good and tangy with masala and lime.

We were also served hot chocolate, in the hot drinks category, which was pretty rich, think and welcoming.

We then moved on to the burger and sandwiches section, where we sampled a variety of them. Among burgers, we had egg fried burger, veg burger, chicken burger and chicken cheese burger. All of the burgers were brilliant. The bun was soft and the patty was well-seasoned, soft and moist. The egg fried burger came with a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg, and the chicken cheese burger had a layer of cheese. All the burgers came with tomatoes and lettuce to add some freshness to the protein bases, and were generously drizzled with spicy mayonnaise dip.

Next we had sunny side chicken club sandwich and veg sandwich. Again, both were brilliant. The stuffing of the chicken sandwich with a layer of chicken sandwiched between two layers of egg was heavenly - one of the best sandwiches I had till date. The veg sandwich was stuffed with mashed potato, tomato, onions, etc.

Unlike the Burgers and Sandwiches, the pizzas didn‚Äôt impress us as much. The tandoori chicken pizza was not so well made. The crust was thick and dry. Also, the topping had generous chunks of chicken but the taste was average. However, An idea special veg pizza, which we had next, was better than the chicken pizza. The crust was well baked and not as hard and dry as the earlier one. It was topped with cheese, pineapple, corn, olives and other veggies which tasted good.

The next dish was mix sauce pasta. This was good except for the fact that the penne needed to be a little more boiled and the sauces were not mixed properly in the entire pasta. Overall, it was a good dish but our expectations were a little high after having the burgers and sandwiches.

Crispy chilli chicken was presented to us in a very typical way which didn't appeal to any of us. The dish tasted average as the chicken was crisp from outside but dry from inside.

To end our meal, we had brownie with chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream. This was the most disappointing part of the meal ! The brownie tasted very poor and was not at all hot as it should have been. Neither was the chocolate sauce hot. The vanilla ice cream scoop at the top was again in the form of a chunk and not a proper scoop.

We had a good time but there are a few areas which need a bit of work. The music was too loud. Also, the staff was too miser in providing napkins. Overall, the place has scope for much improvement. Some of the dishes like drinks, burgers and sandwiches were brilliant. The pizza, pasta and the brownie were average and hence need improvement. Also, incorporating some more dessert options in the menu apart from brownie would be beneficial. |
 
An Idea | Tanwyee Ray | None | 402819 | 3.5 | 2016-03-02 23:40:22 | A new caf√© in the city named "An Idea". It's located at Park circus, exactly opposite to Haji Saheb at circus avenue and 2-3 minutes walk from seven point crossing. I was invited to the cafe through 'panch phoron' group. It was a food tasting session on a weekday evening.
    It is an easy find ofcourse but now the entrance is a bit congested due to KMC work.

    The interior is spacious enough with white walls and white tiled floor which soothe your eyes and mind. The colorful ceiling and few quotes on walls here and there breaks the monotony and it will keep you busy. Speedy numbers were being played. It has two floors. The upper one is smaller and very cozy. It is more colorful too. The sofas and chairs were comfortable. It can accommodate around 24-26 people at a time.

  The caf√© serves hookah too but since I don't take hookah, i skipped it.

   First of all, we were served with drinks. We tasted-- Blue lagoon, Mango smoothie, Ice frappe, Green apple lemonade, Ice frappe, Hot chocolate, Masala lemonade.
   Blue lagoon was refreshing with a dash of sourness.
    Mango smoothie was a bit thick, sweet with crushed ice and mango pieces and of course a must have during hot summer.
    Ice frappe served with a scoop of ice cream was not that good. It didn't have right consistency and was too thin and the flavour didn't come out properly.
     Green apple lemonade was again a thumbs up for me. It was tangy, cool and thirst-quenching. 
      Hot chocolate was really good with chocolate sauce on top of it having right consistency. was warm and the aroma and taste will provide comfort on chilly winter.
      Masala lemonade was as usual good and a bit tangy mixed with jal jeera.

   Next we had-- Egg fried burger, Veg burger, Chicken cheese burger, Chicken burger, Sunny side chicken club sandwich, Veg sandwich,Chicken tandoori pizza,An Idea special veg pizza, Crispy chilli chicken, Mixed sauce pasta.
    Egg fried burger was stuffed with aloo (potato) patty and poached egg, cheese and mayonnaise and lettuce. The bread was soft and the whole thing tasted great.
    Veg burger was stuffed with aloo patty,tomatoes, cucumbers,onions and lettuce with mayonnaise and again was great(though veg).
    Chicken cheese burger was stuffed with chicken patty, cheese,lettuce, cucumber and was amazing in taste though slightly salty.
    Chicken burger was good too. It was simple yet awesome.
     Sunny side chicken club sandwich had two stuffings with three layers served with mayonnaise and tomato ketch up.One stuffing was with chicken whereas another one with egg and was delicious though I missed the crisp of toast.
      Veg sandwich was stuffed with onions, tomatoes and cucumbers. Here I loved the crispness and served with mayonnaise and tomato ketch up. It tasted decent.
      Chicken tandoori pizza couldn't impress me much. The crust was thick but hard as a result of which I had to chew hard though and tasted average.
      An Idea special veg pizza was good topped with corns,capsicums,black olives. The crust was soft enough and yummy.
      Crispy chilli chicken was crispy,spicy and tasted good but i didn't like the presentation. 
      Mixed sauce pasta was a thumbs up for me. The blend of sauces was well proportional. Penne need to be boiled a bit more so that it could have been melted in mouth. But the taste was nice.

   For dessert, we had brownie with ice cream. Brownie was cold and as a result it was hard. So it could have been tasted better.
   
   Food and drinks are reasonably priced and service is fast enough. |

An Idea | Joyjeet Gupta | None | 557729 | 3.5 | 2015-10-29 15:29:18 | Located in AJC bose rd near hai saheb this is newly opened outlet is real good.

its a 2 floored cafe,with a nice seating arrangement and quirky wall and ceiling decor and ample space around alongside a big screen to go with ,which I think should be used to screen sports to bring in more clientele.

I tried the combo of Pizza(veg is normally served in the combo, for non-veg 30 INR extra is charged) +Soup+Soft drink along with brownie.

The pizza was nice ,thin crust with a nice layer of cheese and toppings,but the soup was a sadly a disaster,was more of a curry than soup and too much oil quotient, Coming to the brownie,ice cream wasn't available alongside thus we stuck to chocolate.The brownie was on the softer side and not warm,it was not bad but ok.¬†

Service wise they are real good and wi-fi is also available.Since its opened up very recently I'm expecting the food quality to go up.

Its easy on the pocket aswl.TO ZOMATO please update that NON-VEG food is also available here. |

Tried their chicken sandwich and cold coffee once and a combo meal (veg sandwich, omlette, fries, orange juice - Rs 130) the other time, both being good in taste. |

Monkey Bar | Sirsha Dhar | None | 2015246 | 4.5 | 2016-12-15 21:54:11 | My friend, who was leaving the city soon wanted to go out for food and drinks and what could have been better than our decision to hit the Monkey Bar. Finally opened in Kolkata, one of the best-located bar there possibly is. On the 9th floor of Fort Knox on Camac Street, this looks down the beautiful Kolkata skyline with the 2nd bridge, Victoria, St. Pauls church and what not. The place is huge, quaintly decorated with the essential Bong touch both in the menu and the bar. Has an open area with a huge screen. 
For food we ordered the Mobar Caramelised Pork Ribs. Melt in the mouth pork meat. Smoked Chicken, Chicken Salami and Harissa pizza. For drinks we took the Beamer LIIT. Just the right punch of alcohol and tang! Lovely experience. Would definitely like to go back again. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohan Belani | None | 3081061 | 3.5 | 2016-12-15 02:58:39 | The place has a chill vibe . Went with a few school buddies.  There is a open air section as well as an indoor section where you can sit and chill . Drinks were nice . Service could be better . The staff were not attentive enough . Lastly the music . There were people singing karaoke. I mean it's cool to sing and all but we expected some chill music with the setting . |
 
Monkey Bar | Pratik Shah | None | 31614924 | 3.0 | 2016-12-14 13:50:20 | With an indoor and outdoor seating options and great ambience "monkey bar" is sure to impress you . I didnt order much to eat , bt watever i ordered was average - 
Yes it is lil on the expensive side - overall good place to chill once in a while . |

A complete thumbs up .. the only thumbs down would be the quantity  of the food served , it's too little and gives u just a taste of the dish !! |
 
Monkey Bar | Avinaba Das Sarkar | None | 409341 | 3.0 | 2016-12-11 11:02:59 | Went yesterday with a business partner, wasn't really very particular about a place but since it was located near by thought of visiting it once. Few observations

1. The ambiance is nice and the interiors are pretty well done.

2. Music is pretty loud and if you are intending to have a prolonged conversation with someone it would be difficult. 

3. The biggest drawback is the food, we ordered two veg starters since my friend was veg. The quantity and the taste wasn't something justifying the price or the brand. The food was OK but it isn't something one will find difficult to prepare in there kitchen. 

Overall experience was okay since we primarily went there to seat and talk. But comparing the same with the likes to cafe mezzuna or the grid would make this place average at the best. Hope the management looks into it. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rishi Agarwal | None | 1632482 | 4.5 | 2016-12-10 17:02:43 | On the 9th floor at Fort Knox, the newly opened Monkey Bar is a beautiful place to visit. The place offers an unmatched view of the city and the interiors and a class apart which make it one step ahead of other places in the city.
The food on offer is delicious. The mushrooms I ordered and the chilli cheese dragons are a must try for all.
Overall a great new place to visit with a great atmosphere and very polite attendants. |
 
Monkey Bar | TraveKings | None | 29893242 | 4.5 | 2016-12-07 13:14:55 | Located at Fort Knox. It is like Social in Delhi. Good Ambience. Maintaining a Good Standard. Decent Crowd. Decent Hookah & Decent Food. Good Service.¬†2 big screen to enjoy live sports .¬†Little expensive. It will cost around Rs.3000 for 2 person.A Good place to hangout with friends. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sukanya Ghosh | None | 589490 | 3.5 | 2016-12-04 21:24:11 | This one is new in Kolkata, and is definitely pulling lot of crowd. I went there on a Friday evening with two of my friends and it was full of people. Located in camac street, near Urban Desi, not too difficult to locate. The moment you step in , the first thing you notice are the big french windows with a view to die for :), Howrah Bridge and Victoria Memorial at the same, who would not love that!¬†
Now coming to the food, its nothing extraordinary, very mediocre tasting with prices on the higher side. We ordered for 1 mix mushroom bruschetta, mushroom and truffle oil pizza, and tikki of joy (fish). The bruschetta and the pizza was very ordinary, bland in taste I would say. Tikki of joy was definitely good with very subtle flavours, perfectly cooked to perfection.
My rating is truly for the ambience and the fish, anyway one could always try out this place¬†
Thumbs up for the view :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Gunjan Saraf | None | 33964908 | 4.5 | 2016-12-03 14:49:16 | My visit to this place raised my bar of expectations from kolkatas nightlife.. Posh crowd, sophisticated ambience, soothing music, projector screen for matches, good food and superb hukka! The place has it all. We ordered for lebanese platter and cheese spring rolls, both finger licking good! The capuccino cofee was average but the hukka made up for it! A must visit for all the crazy kolkatans looking for a break from chai break! |
 
Monkey Bar | Subham Agarwal | None | 777244 | 1.0 | 2016-12-01 13:05:10 | THIS PLACE IS PATHETIC

I ATE THE PANEER KHICHDI AND I AND MY FRIEND BOTH ¬†HAD A TERRIBLE INFECTION AFTER HAVING THIS. I THINK THEIR COOKING STANDARDS ARE VERY LOW.

WHEN I CALLED THEM TO SAY THAT I HAD A TERRIBLE INFECTION AFTER HAVING YOUR FOOD THEY ¬†HAD NO ANSWER.

I HAVE ALSO PUT UP A COMPLAIN AT FOOD AND QUALITY STANDARDS DEPARTMENT AGAINST THEM,

I SUGGEST NO ONE SHOULD GO THERE AT ALL. |

Food: chicken nachos is a good quantity. Mediterranean platter a lovly combo of flavors n great taste. Pizzas are thin crust n perfect. Drinks are innovative, I tried mamas girl & mojitos. Its one a litl higher side on the pocket but not exorbitant. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sanjiv Sood | None | 186102 | 4.5 | 2016-11-26 07:39:01 | The ‚ÄòMonkey Bar‚Äô Kolkata Avatar is a welcome addition to it's watering hole map and what an experience it metes out! Located in the heart of the city (Camac Street) with a huge and lofty space, it exudes a comfort zone feel. The visual delight of the interior space couples well with a spectacular view of the Kolkata skyline from the restaurant.¬†

The cream de la cr√®me among the restaurant‚Äôs USP's is the outdoor seating arrangement of about 5-6 tables. Although open to air, yet it is air-conditioned to beat the muggier months. Incidentally during the clement months it would be a pronounced experience to soak in Kolkata‚Äôs mild winters. The corner verandah serves hookah for the y-generation and for those who love to smoke with their tipple it is a rather comfortable space. I loved the incipient November chill all through the evening in the outdoor! It would be an idyllic place all through the wintery months to soak in the chilled weather.

Though I am not a cocktail loving person, I ventured out to try some of their swinging concoctions. First shot was the famed Manga.

Sweet and Tangy Vodka based cocktail, it had an all desi flavour burst from the Aam Panna as the main base with its signature cumin flavour to follow. It comes in a kullar shaped glass with etched in a typical Hinglish font that sets the tone for a fusion evening. 
Next, was the more stylized ‚ÄòMad Men‚Äô a Bourbon base with Coffee Orange and a whiff of Rosemary spray, which, I really liked and got myself a double dose.

 
 

Getting headier, I tried out the Copper Monkey, lo and behold but predictably it was in a copper mug. I quite liked the passion fruit flavour and the hint of mint in it worked well.

¬†

Although christened as ‚ÄòMonkey Bar‚Äô one would be rather surprised to see a super array of fusion food alongwith some very innovative desi leaning twisters. One look at the menu and I was instantly attracted to the Laal Maas Phulka Tacos, Radish cake bites for its novelty, Mobar Caramelized Pork ribs for its slow cooking and the Butterfly Chicken for the signature shells. 
The Laal Maas in the Phulka Tacos was juicy and well done, served on a ¬†Bao Stand for appeal as well as to function as a 'hold on'.  The meat was unique in flavour and spiced up enough to support its Laal Maas Status! 

 

The radish /mooli cake bites were indeed a experience though one really cannot make out if radish is used as the main filling ingredient unless told. The Tempura batter and the black bean sauce make up for the frunchy bite and flavour of the Radish bites.

 

The caramelized rib was succulent and smokey, living up the 6-hour slow cooked traditional method. So was it's house sauce quite zesty and lip smacking. 

 

The Butterfly Chicken was perhaps the only dish, which I would give the pass, though a visual delight again. I was lead to believe or was expecting a Butter Chicken filling. Maybe that is a good idea too.

Overall this place is not all just ambience, though that feeling is certainly overwhelming and sets up the mood. The service, food and the liquid chemistry in the cocktails are commendable too.

Monkey Bar | Kaustav Nayak | None | 1276373 | 5.0 | 2016-11-25 09:43:48 | With its French windows giving a glimpse of both the Victoria Memorial as well as the Howrah Bridge, the ambient lighting, great music, brick walls, a gorgeous skylight, a section that projects black and white motion picture and an apparently messy but ultimately symmetric seating arrangement that will please the OCD in you, Monkey Bar is hands down the best looking place in town. The ambiance, crowd and the location itself (9th floor of the Fort Knox building in Camac Street) itself demands a high rating. But it outdoes itself in the food department as well.¬†

The tiger beef is an instant classic. Perfectly cooked and just the right amount oily, this is a dish that I will highly recommend. The chettinad chicken samosas on the other hand flattered to deceive, definitely not worth the high price. Reddy's chicken popcorn though is a whole different story : small pieces of chicken fried with curry leaves, ¬†sesame, coconut shreds and a concoction of south Indian spices.¬†The name that will pique your interest however is the butter chicken khichudi. Bengali style sticky rice cooked amalgamated with Punjabi style chicken butter masala, this is a dish that has sharp flavors very well attuned for the Indian tongue. I absolutely loved it! 4 small cups containing curd, ghee, pickle and papad are given as accompaniments.¬†
¬†

And just everything else, their dessert section is more than competent too. While the snicker bar with its milk chocolate ganache on a crunchy almond base and a chocolate cake below may feel a tad too sweet, they provide a coffee ice cream to go with it and together the balance is delectable. The gondhoraj lime tart was more in my wheelhouse : the tangy lime curd really stood out. If I have to recommend one among these two I'd say take a leap of faith, ditch the always reliable chocolate and go for the tart.¬†

Here's to next time. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pratik Sensarma | None | 10848301 | 5.0 | 2016-11-22 20:50:17 | A too good place to b with your friends...had been there some days before...services are good...and ambience... Wat a place... After a long time had been to such an awesome place like this... One could have a marvelous view of the city Kolkata... Specially our Victoria memorial and cathedral Church...the foods are very tasty ...starting from Manga , tiger beef, tikki of joye to other cocktails  everything was perfectly made and served. Then lastly the desserts...the chocolate cake mainly... Was the best... Really had an too good time..keep it up guys  :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Anusreea Paul | None | 2257306 | 4.5 | 2016-11-21 12:13:39 | The famous brand is finally here in Kolkata. It's been three months since they opened doors on Camac Street and there's been no looking back for them :)
Had the opportunity to visit the place thanks to a bloggers meet. This is the brain child of chef Manu Chandra, the team, the food is crafted by him. The place epitomizes awesomeness in every inch. The place is big, read huge!! The huge old school windows lead you to stare at the city landscape with wide open eyes. They have an open seating arena, high rise chairs and comfortable sofas to choose from. They serve alcohol and hookah. They even arrange for sundowners on wintry afternoons, for you to sip on their lavish cocktails and enjoy the sun going down. The Victoria Memorial and the Howrah bridge are visual delights. They have their pub rules hence it is better to read them up and visit!
The crafted menu for the afternoon:

**Drinks**

Copper Monkey: Served in a copper vessel with a ¬†chunk of orange came this cocktail, whiskey based.

Manga: The ever famous drink, vodka based, a concoct of vodka and mango pulp.

Hipster Smash: Smacking name, and a refreshing drink! The array of colors are incredible. Mix of watermelon juice, a huge chunk of frozen watermelon and vodka.

Old Fashioned on Camac: The name might sound synonymous with rum but it is a whiskey based cocktail.

**Food**

Kerala Red Rice: A vegetarian and a non-vegetarians' delight! Thick red rice mixed with southern spices. It's spicy, it's crunchy, and it's tangy!!

Tiger Beef: The best, best, best beef is served here!! A bowlful of spicy meaty delight!! The shredded, well cooked, perfectly spiced beef served as the best chakna with the cocktails. Quite filling, good in quantity. Must order and highly recommended.

Butterfly Chicken: The outer coatings are designed like butterflies. Fried to perfection, oil less, the butterfly winged shaped cups are visual delights. Filled inside the cups are shredded chicken mixed in a nice sauce. Recommended for the sheer taste, intensity of the dish, and the efforts behind the perfect butterfly wings!

Shammi Sliders: These little burgers are lovely to look at. They do not fill you up completely yet leave you quite satisfied. The minced meat patties are perfect and there's no saucy drips. You actually do not mess yourself up eating this. Accompanied with some house special fries served inside a cute monkey bar wrapper.

Tikki of Joy: Quite a big hit down south, they decided to include it in their Kolkata menu as well. Huge chunks of bhetki frie to perfection. Served with onion rings and mint chutney. Crispy, ample fish in every mouthful, not oily at all.

Lal Maas Phulka Tacos: even sized parathas half rolled like rolls, filled with minced juicy meat. The meat is tender and you would feel like you are eating a roll, Kolkata style!!

**Desserts**

Gondhoraj Lime Tart: Tad a bit too bitter if eaten without the entire chunk. The idea is take a bit of the biscuit base, the creme, the lemon curd, the pistachio cake, and the raspberry sugared petals. And you could keep eating that and stare into the dreamy wintry sky line. But make sure to get a window seat..:)

Old Monkey Signature Chocolate Cake: What is a chocolate if it does not make you high!!! Well, this one sure does...a huge chunk of chocolate bar sprinkled with praline and caramel sauce. Served with a little scoop of ice cream...aaahhh never felt better!!¬†

Guys, agar aap Monkey Bar nahi gaye to please jaldi jaiye...it's waiting for you!! The coolest place in town to rock and roll. Try their karaoke nights or their usual dining hours, you will not be disappointing!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Suruchi Bhawsinghka | None | 1140387 | 3.0 | 2016-11-21 09:59:22 | The amount of tax,service charge vat, and wat not they are adding is insane.I have been to so many resto ,trust me this place is not worth it.I would rather sit in a five-star hotel lounge to spend around 5k between 4 ppl. If you leave aside the taxes you would always want to visit this place .Loved d simple decor(specially the huge windows ) perfect place to chill with friends and enjoy your drink.Snacks are average .Guys pls check ur taxes ...u r being unreasonable !!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Prarthana Roy | None | 1683183 | 3.5 | 2016-11-20 21:42:56 | Firstly , very much overpriced ! But fell in love with their decor and view .. food is overpriced according to their portion and most importantly they don't taste sound to be priced that much ! And coming to tax .. 1000 bucks ?! U will surely be left with a whole in ur pocket .. recommended for once , strictly ! |

Monkey Bar | Dhawal Pratap SIngh | None | 442772 | 3.5 | 2016-11-14 14:34:01 | The place has excellent ambience and definitely scores well on the food quality. However, the portions are really small adding on to the already heavy cost. Instead of 1500 for 2, its a place where you will incur Rs1500 per person. Plus the taxes are a lot on the pocket. Our regular bill of Rs 4800 had Rs2000 worth of taxes amounting to a total of Rs 6800! Paying 40% tax on top of my bill is not something I was looking forward to. |
 
Monkey Bar | Supriya Baid | None | 34842096 | 5.0 | 2016-11-13 20:55:15 | One of the best ambience i have ever seem in kolkata! Fabulous üëå great crowd. Good servers. Well maintained. Lovely presentation of food. Hookah love üíï keep it up guys ‚úå |
 
Monkey Bar | Shruti Keshri | None | 12428511 | 1.0 | 2016-11-08 22:26:50 | Pathetic place, the food quantity is so less, waiters don't understand anything, once you order the order only comes when you die hungry. We waited for  bill for almost 14 mins and then left, the waiter came running out to get the bill, and top of that the bill was wrong, they charged us for we didn't order also.

Over priced, lazy, pathetic place. Never visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | The Calcutta Foodie | None | 36569739 | 4.5 | 2016-11-08 11:14:50 | Monkey bar is the newest attraction in town and rightly so, talking about interiors the biggest hit is the huge Windows showing the skyline of Calcutta, it's a breathtaking view from the 9th floor. 

The menu is quite innovative and the concoctions in terms of the cocktails are pretty darn good.

The food doesn't disappoint at all the butterfly chicken was crispy and juicy which is very rare a combination and the pork ribs had a smokey barbecue flavour to them and were very, very soft. 

The place is slightly expensive, but, with that ambience and quality, it's hardly an issue. |
 
Monkey Bar | Ms_WalkingShoes | None | 1193155 | 4.5 | 2016-11-07 18:24:29 | Read d reviews on Zomato n planned to pop over to dis place.
The interiors..ambience...music..crowd n d staff is absolutely perfect.
The view is jus mindblowing n d breeze is so soothing.
We ordered Prawn Pil Pil which was yum..
The Beef Pickle and the Pork Sausages were a bit disappointing.
We had two beers and a virgin mojito.
D thing dat was bit disappointing was dat our bill was 2368Rs...out of which 535Rs was jus all kinda tax.
Overall this place is one of d best plc to hangout around. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rishav Dey | None | 193398 | 4.0 | 2016-11-07 14:01:53 | Six of us landed up at Monkey Bar on a Saturday evening. It was a nightlife hotspot at 19:30 hours already and we had to wait almost 40 minutes before we could be seated. We were ushered in and given the offer of crowding around the bar which we accepted.
The ambiance was great. Music was good and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Making a conversation wasn't the easiest thing to do but at places like this that is quite expected. 
We kicked off the evening with a portion of Loaded Nachos, 4 helpings of Pack a Punch, one Old Fashioned on Camac with bourbon and one Mama's Girl with Absolut. The last two we had to settle for because Toast to Calcutta couldn't me made due to lack of availability of gin. The nachos were appetizing and I liked my old fashioned with bourbon but the accompanying almond biscotti was too sweet for me. The pack a punch was good but the Mama's Girl was not appreciated by any one.
The Aam Admi Eggs went down well with me. It reminded me of the bhel puri walas and their chutneys. The eggs were soft but firm. It made me crave a bit for the soft, gooey and runny yolk. The Hispter Smash was nice but the Tipsy Sherbet was quite interesting for me because I have always wondered how alcohol would blend with rose syrup and Mo Bar did a wonderful job. The Copper Monkey was a bit like a fruity mint julep but I did like it. The Not so Vanilla was not quite my kind of cocktail with the creamy texture so I exchanged that for the Hipster Smash with a friend. The best cocktail according to me was by far the Mad Men. All the flavours combined really well and complimented each other beautifully. Coffee and orange always work well but the subtle rosemary was a delightful addition. 
The duck pita pockets were great. Oriental flavours in between a pita was an unusual combination but the pita seemed to go quite well with the duck in five spice and the hoisin sauce. The Kerala Beef Fry was nice but I would have loved to have it with Malabar parotta instead of the bread they served. The smoked chicken pizza was decent too. 
The service was very good. There was a period in between when we were very unhappy with the excruciatingly slow service but our server was extremely apologetic about it and cited the reason of a busy weekend evening for the barmen. It was understandable as far as I was concerned. The value for money is perhaps a bit on the lower side and I would say Mo Bar is a moderately expensive place. The food was mostly good. The drinks too were mostly very good. And I couldn't get enough of the Mad Men. So I will return for the Mad Men and to try the beef bulgogi, tiger beef, Goan chrizo pav, baked brie and prawn ghee roast. Recommended if one doesn't mind spending a bit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sharan Bansal | None | 394157 | 5.0 | 2016-11-06 18:14:14 | Amazing new York style ambience in Kolkata. Great hospitality and service! We had an awesome Sunday lunch with friends over champagne , rum punch and beer ! |

Monkey Bar | Harsh Agarwal | None | 615445 | 4.5 | 2016-11-03 22:40:49 | Food, decor and ambience is top notch. Kolkata has got a Gem restaurant and bar. The view and seating is made for each other.

For the egg lovers-"Aam aadmi eggs. Sheer brilliant dish. Must try if you visit.

The staff needs to be a little polite and polished. Lack hospitality and softness. If they can improve upon this, it will be no doubt the finest joint in the city.

Will surely visit again. |

Monkey Bar | Rahul | None | 20537314 | 4.0 | 2016-10-31 13:45:15 | Great food, smooth shisha and pleasant staff at a great location. The food served was fresh and tasty. Though the open area for shisha is a little congested. This is a perfect alternative to bar exchange since the staff is very pleasant. Had an outing with 8 of team mates on October 25, costed 7.5 k excluding alcohol. Will be my preferred location for after work outings as long as the staff is pleasant. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pooja Marwaha | None | 1981882 | 4.0 | 2016-10-30 23:11:30 | One of the new places opened in Calcutta. This place has a great view of the city with good music. When I say good music, I mean music in the background and you can hear the person sitting opposite to you. The service is spot on. The servers attend to you first and do not chit chat in a corner. Now the food, ordered a farmers pizza which was good enough for an evening snack. The best thing that happened during the evening was the hookah. It was so smooth yet gave the kick. After a very long had really good hookah. The price pinch is moderate too. Would definitely visit more often now. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Agrawal | None | 1902980 | 4.5 | 2016-10-30 00:43:02 | Since its opening, have been there couple of times already. The evening view of the city is definitely one of the the ups of the place.¬†
The ambience is awesome and the right kind of classy touch interiors makes you want to come n relax with friends.¬†
The mocktails were good, and some dishes mentioning special mention are Chilli Cheese dragons, Med platter, Falafel Sliders and Mobar Laksa.¬†
Thanks Avantika for bringing the Monkey to town. :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Divya Khettry | None | 1930204 | 4.0 | 2016-10-29 12:09:30 | Finally the Monkey swings East! Must day amazing ambience and view. Drinks were great too the only thing I didn't like here was the food its a little average. I also loved the music all my fav tracks were played. |
 
Monkey Bar | Tushar Goyal | None | 1881622 | 4.5 | 2016-10-29 10:47:35 | Unluckily I ended up to the place on a Thursday and it was a dry day there, but the food was phenomenal . The moment you see the menu you want to try everything .

We ordered loaded nacho was very good , beet and orange salad which was ok , kimchi baby potatoes is a must try.
For the mains I ordered paneer kichdi which was good and the soulful bowl chilly paneer was good too. 

Going to go again for the non- veg very soon . |
 
Monkey Bar | Komal Agarwal | None | 34017613 | 3.5 | 2016-10-27 19:38:37 | The only good part about this place was the ambience and picturesque settings. Food is nothing worth mentioning. The spaghetti pasta was bad. Spring rolls & nachos were okay. Among the drinks, I really liked the Virgin Mangaa. |

Was there for lunch.ambience is very good and the moment I entered it felt like its a lovely place for a winter lazy afternoon date. very clean.As we went in a large group the service was a bit slow.I hope as the restaurant ages it will be sorted out.butter chicken khichdi was good.smoothies and drink were also good.I had tried prawn which was also very tasty.I loved the interior,very classy specially the open area to sit.should try once.

Monkey Bar | Chandramouli Daga | None | 15803042 | 4.0 | 2016-10-24 20:41:36 | A sensational space with a terrific view of the Calcutta skyline. While it is expensive and the cocktails might not cater to everyone, the food is experimantally delicious while the service is admirable. 

Happening! And how! |
 
Monkey Bar | Moumita Das Talukdar | None | 343640 | 4.0 | 2016-10-24 20:01:03 | Visited this place at Fort Knox building 9th floor- the new outlet to party with friends. Gorgeous interiors and a stellar reputation as a chain we went there with high expectations and we were satisfied.Spectacular view with good music and awsum food. Innovative cocktails , lipsmacking pork and beef dishes.A must try joint. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anurag Jaiswal | None | 1778047 | 4.5 | 2016-10-24 18:14:19 | Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox building. The food & service are excellent. Ambiance is awesome. Per pax-Rs.1000 with drinks (inclusive of taxes) |
 
Monkey Bar | Sanjay Bhowmik | None | 29528004 | 4.0 | 2016-10-23 23:36:21 | I think I would rate this place 95% purely for the ambience and the view....the truly quintessential bar and cafe where you can have an awesome conversation at an awesome side table with an awesome view of the metropolis named Kolkata that I am yet to see anywhere in this city....truth be told, I was bedazzled and enamoured by the view....a whole 6/5!!!

Then comes the hard reality....for the few drinks (7), couple of coffee and a few bites, it was almost ‚Çπ4.2k....time to pay for the view!!!!....maybe a tinge more so 3.5/5....but the few hours spent are worth sitting there provided the company / conversation is good....

Nothing to write home about the food taste, just an avg 3.5/5

In the evening they have a good lighting set up and inspite of the crowd, every table and it's occupants had their own space and not intruded upon....it didn't feel cluttered like other such hallmark Kolkatan joints....would have gone for a 4.5/5 but they totally managed to screw that up with thumping music, which could have been easily done through the softer and low volume lounge music!!!...killed the evening ambience....if the idea was to attract the vibrant gen then they missed the fact that there were a whole lot of couples and a few bunch who were engrossed in their own conversation and seemed a bit irritated with the thumping bass....so here's a 3/5 for ruining the awesome layout and view....

If I would ever come again, it would be for the view and the window seats....but guys, do get some class in the music, the environment should provide for individual space, the layout, lighting, setting and ambience are awesome but your music settings are truly questionable, at least this time round!!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Gupta | None | 29595954 | 3.0 | 2016-10-23 14:58:41 | I didnt have the food since i wanted north indian cuisine and they dnt serve the same where as Zomato says they serve north indian.... ambience was excellent.... |

Monkey Bar | Munmun Banerjee Ghosh | None | 13780291 | 5.0 | 2016-10-21 09:22:56 | Excellent food!Good cocktails.Even better music.And the best part of Monkey Bar is the view.Perfect blend to fall in love with the city,all over again.Must-visit!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sunanda Ghosh | None | 2720210 | 4.0 | 2016-10-20 12:21:51 | The newest addition to Camac Street, Monkey bar holds the promise of becoming one of the coolest hangouts for GenY. Situated on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building, it offers a panoramic view of the city through huge glass windows and what's more there's even arrangement for outdoor seating. The decor is charming and an awesome background score makes the ambience perfect for chilling out with your friends over great food and drinks. Firstly we ordered a butterfly chicken and duck pita pockets. The chicken was delicious and crispy tossed with bell peppers, chilli flakes and stuffed in crunchy butterfly shells and the duck meat marinated with spices and packed inside soft pita bread created fireworks in our mouths. We also went for a smoked chicken, chicken salami and harissa pizza which was superb, to say the least. There was another Hearty bowl, a heartwarming chicken broth with bean sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, flat noodles and bokchoy sprinkled with chilli oil. We finished off with Mobar Sundae Sandwich, an ice cream cake with nuts layered with nutella and tutti fruti. We also tried their hookah and the shisha is really good and strong. The service is more of less..efficient and the staff polite..but the pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side. They recently acquired their bar license, so would love to drop in again for a taste of their cocktails! |
 
Monkey Bar | Pamela Nandi | None | 2821382 | 3.0 | 2016-10-20 01:06:16 | No doubt this place has an amazing ambience with an indoor and outdoor seating area styled in the form of british pub, but food and service is very very poor.¬† We went on ashtami night with friends, they took about an hour to prepare the chicken stacked as saslik to grill it. Once served, the dish was just tasteless. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sunrita Sarkar | None | 804376 | 5.0 | 2016-10-18 22:44:36 | Hi, if you love Calcutta , good music(and by good music I mean led zeppelin and pink flyod and classics as such ) and a brilliant view of Calcutta, this is the place to be. 

We ordered a pack up punch, Sangria and a 100 pipers based cocktail. All three were pretty different and pretty well made. 

We didn't order any food as we were so engrossed in the decor and view. 

The hospitality was brilliant. 

Do give it a visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Aritra Roy | None | 145459 | 4.5 | 2016-10-17 22:31:23 | Already visited twice in such a short span of opening its doors in Kolkata, Monkey Bar has been fabulous on both occasions. Situated on the top floor of Fort Knox, it provides a magnificent view of the Kolkata skyline with Victoria Memorial, St Pauls Cathedral, Hooghly bridge and the 42 which is the tallest building here.

The food has been great and is presented in a unique way. Ordered Chilli Cheese dragons, Mac and cheese croquettes, Butterfly chicken and Chicken Chimichurri on the first time along with Mangaa mocktail. On the repeat, we ordered Mobar caramel ribs, Tiger beef, Reddys popcorn chicken alongwith a Smoked chicken pizza. In drinks, we had copper monkey , house made ginger beer with a couple of KF ultras.

However special mention must go to the desserts, Snicker bar is just too good while Nolen gur creme brulee was delicious.
They have a small open air area for hookah as well. The service is prompt and the ambience is quite relaxing. The bar looks pretty while the music changes over time with comforting tracks during evening to partying ones as the night progresses on.

Overall, the Kolkata gastropub scene is proud to have Monkey bar in its lineup. Hope it gets better from here.Cant wait to visit soon again :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Rupsha Bhadra | None | 606325 | 4.5 | 2016-10-16 14:33:22 | Monkey bar in Delhi is a location that is a part of some very special memories so I had really high expectations from its Calcutta counterpart. It certainly did not disappoint. We ordered loaded chicken nachos, the butter chicken kichdi, smoked chicken pizza and others. The butter chicken khichdi was really impressive. So were the cocktails Maanga and Copper monkey. A little on the higher side when it comes to the pocket pinch, monkey bar did live up to all the expectations. And the view is just fantastic. |
 
Monkey Bar | Madhurya Sarkar | None | 6309371 | 5.0 | 2016-10-16 12:11:35 | Just loved it.
The ambiance, the playlist, the skyline view, the staff management, the food and everything is just superb of this pub. This is located in the 9th floor of Knox building opposite to Urban desi. We visited late afternoon but the best time would be to hit this place in the evening. This can be an ideal place to go a date with your partner :)
The view of St. Paul's Cathedral, Victoria Memorial and Hooghly Bridge adds flavour to their ambiance.
Coming to food we had kingfisher premium beer, chicken wings and chocolate lava cake. All of the dishes were value for money. Overall had an excellent experience.
Coming back soon :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Syed Murtaza Jafar | None | 32607152 | 5.0 | 2016-10-16 04:52:57 | Ok, so same night we visited The Great Booze Story and Monkey Bar, and I'll say Monkey Bar won big time. Just opposite Urban Desi (will visit soon), good collection of music, courteous and attentive staff, this is one venue that you would want to visit again. The ambience, the view of the The Victoria Memorial is just a sight to look at. Safe to say, I'll be coming back to this place soon |

Monkey Bar | Rashmi Adhikary | None | 31014016 | 4.5 | 2016-10-14 14:26:12 | We visited Monkey Bar on Saptami evening, and had a spectacular time. The ambience is lively, the music is great, the decor very impressive and the service commendable.  
Now coming to the sumptuous meal; an assortment of drinks - whiskey, tequila, rum, virgin mojita, espresso -  was ordered with starters being Butterfly Chicken and Chicken Chapli. Yes, Butterfly Chicken is a definitely worth a try. In the main course, there was Aunty Vinnie's Berry Pulao. Tiger Beef was so delicious that two more dishes were ordered; this is must-try for beef lovers. This is the first place in Kolkata that I see so many beef dishes being offered. Galouti Killer was the other beef dish ordered and equally palatable. I had Mee Goreng which is an Indonesian dish of spiced noodles and got it topped with chicken. 
Overall, it was a great experience in this newly-opened gastropub. |
 
Monkey Bar | Piyush Dalmia | None | 15726652 | 4.5 | 2016-10-13 20:42:49 | Another fab newbie in the city

Talk about the Ambience, Food, Service or the Decor, it excels in all

Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building at Camac Street, it offers a spectacular view of the city
 
The Decor and Seating Arrangements are well made 

They got a separate smoking area which is quite airy, and has ample seating space as well

Shisha was pretty decent and lasted quite a while

Now lets talk about the protagonist here

Nachos were crisp and loaded with cheese, the Platter was appealing and featured variety of items whereas the mocktails were on fleek 

But things which really caught our attention were Spaghetti and Paneer Khidchi

While the former was extremely tasty, the latter is a MUST have dish for sure

All in all, it was a happy dining experience for us |
 
Monkey Bar | Arpita Agarwal | None | 998579 | 4.5 | 2016-10-13 12:39:47 | A new place in town, much awaited. Great ambience! The view is also super!! Maybe they should have had a slightly larger rooftop area. Food is decent too. The nachos were pretty good. The Manga is a must try!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sharmistha Mukherjee | None | 722185 | 4.5 | 2016-10-12 06:49:58 | If you are in Calcutta and love the skyline and a few drinks to go along with it on a hot, rainy or crisp evening this is the place to be. Monkey Bar in Calcutta is done up beautifully and affords you a view of the Victoria Memorial, St Paul's Cathedral and the Hoogly Bridge. The have cocktails and food over and above what they offer in other cities. The hipster smash is delicious to say the least. As was the bourbon cocktail with almond bitters... |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohit Suryawanshi | None | 36318376 | 5.0 | 2016-10-11 18:11:29 | My favourite lalmass Takos ,Pizza and Delicious Chillie cheese Dragon.
The friendliness of the staff seems genuine. I have never seen such good customer service as I experienced. |
 
Monkey Bar | FOODBUFFS | None | 987893 | 4.0 | 2016-10-11 11:16:14 | Visited on Ashtami night.Even though it was a good crowd,we managed to get a table immediately,courtesy to the experienced and efficient management team.There is an open-air seating which mainly caters to people ordering hookah or going there for a puff.Indoor seating is quite large.
Decor is akin to a British pub.Upholstery is comfortable.What allures you are those French windows through which you can catch a great glimpse of the city skyline,from the ninth floor.In the evenings there is muted lighting.Ambience is quite good.We heard some good old day soft music but as the night grew,the DJ started giving groovy yet classy numbers.
Service is warm and polite but there was a lack of professionalism.We were giving the same food order to two or three different men at times.The servers,even though quite courteous,were not quite clearly conversant about the food and beverages,unless asked upon.Details or any recommendations/suggestions were not given on their own.They need to more vocal  and well informed about every detail of the food when the order is being placed.
PAN RASNA HOOKAH-strong flavour,no choking but the smoke was quite weak,unlike to our liking.It was smooth but the smoke didnot last for an hour.It wasnot worth the price charged.Not satisfied.
BUTTERFLY CHICKEN-tastewise quite impressive.Chicken morsels were soft and had a sweet tangy taste.The sauce was pretty good and spicy and the butterfly shells were crispy,the whole presentation looked lovely.Three butterflies were there.
REDDY'S CHICKEN POPCORN-Well this dish took us to South India.Moderately sized chicken morsels deep fried in a batter having a crisp crunchy texture and the taste was so consistent in southern flavours,it tasted good.Curry leaves flavour was predominant and we liked it a lot to go for a second order.
CHICKEN CHIMICHURI-Chicken was soft.They were skewed up but the flavours were quite bland,didnot stand up to our expectations.Not impressive at all,this dish needs improvement.
MEDITERRANEAN PLATTER-Mixed comments.It was great in some parts,not so great in others.Chickpea fries were not so good to taste,seemed a bit too fried where the chickpea stuffing was too less.The pita breads were nice,soft,fluffy,buttered and nicely grilled,tasted good.Hummus was in great quantity,tastewise perfect but the babaghanoush didnot stand out in taste.Cheese filo wraps tasted good.They  had soft spinach with gooey cheese inside wrapped in rice papers and fried.Overall a good dish,you can give it a try if Mediterranean cuisine is your calling.
OLD MONK(EY) CHOCOLATE CAKE-Good.Cake was melt in mouth soft and creamy.Consistency of cream was smooth,light and fluffy.The dessert was classy,superb and hence recommended.
Foodwise we were not that satisfied as much as we were with their cocktails!!
Their BOURBON LIIT,MAD MEN and MAMA'S GIRL were just bang on!The bartender did a great job.The blend was great,the liquor gave a great kick,courtesy the good mixing.They were well balanced in flavours and the ingredients of the drinks very well complimented each other.Spices and mint went well with vodka,and coffee with whisky surely made a great pair.
We also ordered Heineken,Ginger ale and fresh lime soda which was usual.
As far as price is concerned,it is too high for the food and some cocktails! Quantity of food is very less,so doesnot justify the price and tastewise it didnot make a good mark.The cocktails had a price tag which was same as most gastropubs having a good establishment cost,yet they were high.
This pub is a must visit,esp for their awsome cocktails.The gastronome part needs improvement to call it a fair gastropub.Will visit again for sure owing to the overall good experience that we had,a good hangout place and to try other cocktails and entr√©es. |
 
Monkey Bar | Garima Poddar | None | 2714062 | 3.5 | 2016-10-10 23:22:48 | The ambience n decor is nice..I had ordered fr a peach icetea n it was quite refreshing..the chilli cheese dragon was nt that impressive n lacking chilli..onion n capsicum basically the description was amazing bt it was no where near that..nachos was average..spaghetti in red sauce was again average..green thai curry was really nice n d best part was d dessert mobar sundae sandwhch it was like love at first bite |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohit Misra | None | 1561408 | 4.5 | 2016-10-10 11:32:08 | Monkey bar has lived upto the expectations. With crazy ambience and amazing service, it just became my favourite destination in town. Also on a special note, Ripon out there was brilliant with his service. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rima Dhara | None | 1796261 | 2.5 | 2016-10-09 20:08:51 | Nothing great... service is very bad... food is ok.. ambiance is good ... but as a whole coz of service of of the worst place I have ever been.... will not try again ‚òπÔ∏è chicken wasn't fresh... very bad experience ... |
 
Monkey Bar | Sreyashi M. | None | 10853321 | 4.5 | 2016-10-09 19:05:16 | Visited today for lunch, and a had a lovely time! 
I suggest you get a table by the windows. The Kolkata skyline will definitely make your visit even more memorable. 
We tried the Maanga cocktail (5 stars, peeps!) with the Tiger Beef. I suggest you try both. Succulent meat with the zing of your drink makes for some very happy (read: tipsy) people. 
For mains, we tried the Mobar burger and it was heavenly! The Naga pork soulful bowl was fabulous too! Portions are great, flavour is gorgeous and staff is super sweet and nice. 
I hope you maintain what you've got going so I can visit again! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sudipto Mitra | None | 2401672 | 3.5 | 2016-10-09 09:00:39 | Nice decor , awsum view of the cityscape and great cocktails . Food is good to average with a twist and may not be liked by all.
We ordered pitchers of pack a punch,mangaa amd mohjito and the first is the best.

We stuck with finger food only and ordered 
Mushroom bruschetta(good),prawn pil pil(gr8), chicken churi(avg) and tiger beef(gr8)
Rounded everything off with aunty berry pulao which was delicious
 This a typical gastro bar with foot tapping music which is too loud at times, we had to ask it to be turned down.

The service could have been bettet and there  was confusion while seating. We were waiting at the bar for our table to be ready but some other guests jumped on that

Oh forgot to mention a outing here will surely burn a whole in your pocket |
 
Monkey Bar | Vedant Kabra | None | 2240676 | 4.5 | 2016-10-09 08:47:40 | I went to monkey bar last night and I was pretty surprised. Read all the reviews and thoroughly analysed the place in my mind before I went there (it's what I do). 
The guy at the front desk (I believe he was the owner) was phenomenal. So welcoming, so easy going and so 'approachable'. The one at the front desk is the face of any restaurant. He told us we'll have to wait for 40, but we got a table in 20. Told us we'll have to share the table - but eventually we didn't have to. 
I think seating right outside the kitchen + bar worked for us. Didn't have to wait for the food (the cheese drum, nachos and mushroom + truffle oil pizza are INSANE). Ordered quite a bit on the liquor front - barring the martini everything else was really good (fun presentation too!) (including the ginger beer). We had heard so much about the desserts - total let down though (chocolava cake with mint ice cream was terrible I must confess - Mezzuna gets the big ups here). 
The staff was pretty alright (looked a little confused at times). 
Monkey bar must work on guest management (but it is only a few weeks old so it's okay). Thoroughly impressed with the ambience (trumps Mezzuna and all the other hot spots in the city several times over), food, booze and service. 
This place has my highest recommendation. |
 
Monkey Bar | Argha Basu | None | 1892606 | 5.0 | 2016-10-08 15:46:45 | If you want to impress your girlfriend or wife . Just take her there . Take your seat next to the glass wall and enjoy the panaromic view of the Victoria memorial, Vidyasagar Setu and the Howrah Bridge.

Monkey Bar | Puja Das | None | 36272619 | 4.5 | 2016-10-08 12:52:12 | Bookmarks . ¬†It's got an amazing atmosphere with outdoor and indoor seating. Despite going on the weekend it gets the right amount of crowd that makes it a very happening place. Music was really good. We wanted to try a new cocktail, so we went for the ¬†toast to calcutta which was a little different and tasted quite good. Food on the other hand was quite unique. 
service is also impressed us. ¬† ¬†

The place is a little hard to find. But overall it's a nice place for the weekend chill! |
 
Monkey Bar | Tejash | None | 15384381 | 1.5 | 2016-10-08 11:33:48 | Visited this place on 7th October with friends. We were a group of 11 but there is no place for such big group there.  The table we were given was ideal for 7 but we had to squeeze in.  Repeated request for chair felt to deaf ears till such time my friend pulled up the bar chair from the adjacent table. They have limited staff and one server was alloted to the tables.  Needless to say the service was pathetic and totally unacceptable. Our order for beer and ginger ale took 30 mins and after repeated reminders it arrived.  The food is average with limited option for Vegetarian. No one wants to eat "baigan pakora " or " vada pav" at such a place.  We were charged for one item that was ordered but not served. On pointing the same the server "argued" that we didn't realise but it was indeed served to us.  In no mood to hang around any more we just paid and left.  While waiting down for our car we met others who too were very disappointed with the place. 

This will be one of those places in kolkata that will soon be ticked off based on word or mouth and customer experience because of shabby service and attitude of the people who run it. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anshuman Jalan | None | 31752408 | 2.0 | 2016-10-08 00:20:08 | Good atmoshpere ! Average food for vegie lovers ! Place to chill and soak in the music and buzz around . Nothing home to write about the food . And weekend and holidays . aVOID as unable to give service due to rush |
 
Monkey Bar | Darshana Rampuria | None | 2855224 | 3.5 | 2016-10-05 11:34:14 | So finally visited Monkey Bar ! The ambience is good as compared to What we get to see in Kolkata.. but apart from that nothing spectacular and surely cannot be compared to the one in Mumbai ! The food is Too average . We had ordered the Nachos - this one was a disaster , pesto spaghetti ( penne pasta wasn't there!!) - yet again very bland and just not up to the mark . Though tempura and mezze platter was good BUT the Coconut ice cream Dessert was FABULOUS SO an extra 0.50 points for that !! Food needs to be worked upon , staff is courteous ! Best wishes .. hoping my next visit be better and with no complains ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sujan Das | None | 36218418 | 4.5 | 2016-10-03 14:04:44 | I went this place with my friends and I would say this was amazing and was full packed in the weekend without liquor. There ambiance was very good and the music they place is also very nice . There drinks where also very good . They smoking and non smoking area also which was the best part of this place. Good place to spend with your friends. As we been to many other bars but I love this place as they have place to sit and there service was also excellent. They where pack but still there people know how to attend the gust which was very good in this bar. Pocket friendly and staff was excellent smiling and they working and they suggest also if you are new to this place and don't know what to order. I would suggest everyone for this place and sure you will be in love with this place. I basically tried everything on the menu (food and beverage), and yes it is all worth every penny
, I m fan of there menu and food, really enjoyed.¬†

Monkey Bar | Soul !! | None | 32140714 | 4.5 | 2016-10-03 08:50:51 | In a word, wonderful. We been to Delhi Monkey but this is the best one with wonderful view. 
One thing we really missed the Foosball) 
But no matter we had great time, fantastic food, we order lot many things forget the name but pizza and starters are yumm, drinks are also really nice
Staff were very welcoming too.

So keep good work guys !! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sarat | None | 8743511 | 3.0 | 2016-10-03 01:16:59 | ambience is good.. was excited to reach the place.. view n open air is also impressive.. u get a glimpse of the Victoria memorial
Although can't talk about the cocktails(coz we wet on 2nd oct, dry day), but we had the copper monkey mocktail and a ginger beer, we were very happy with both
But sadly food was extremely disappointing.. taste as well as quality is not upto the mark.. ordered the much talked about chicken butterfly, too sweet, no flavour of chicken n tasted Lyk beans on toast
Second ordered the spicy tomato spaghetti, worst I hav ever had, tasted like Maggi with tomato
Butter chicken khichadi was good,,, good innovation
Snickerbar, dessert, was well mind blowing if u hav a sweet tooth.. very nice and balanced taste
But the whole dining experience was not satisfactory |
 
Monkey Bar | Nikita Ramgarhia | None | 903737 | 2.5 | 2016-10-01 10:11:42 | An over hyped place.
The only plus points are the ambience and the service.
The hookah is average and food simply disappoints.
The vada pao is good.
The Mac and cheese croquettes have peas in them..like who does peas with cheese and Mac..
Too bad with the experimentation guys..
And the potato rackett is also very bland.
Galauti is average..
You guys are better in other cities I have heard..so pls improve in Kolkata |
 
Monkey Bar | Bindu | None | 36159071 | 3.5 | 2016-09-29 00:55:19 | At last chef manu chandra with his concept of monkey bar has entered in Kolkata.but sorry to say the food and service has dissapointed on comparison with the monkey bars in bombay and bangalore.
Need to check before its too late its my first experience but once more will love to try so that they can still improvise. |
 
Monkey Bar | Harish Todi | None | 1076456 | 2.0 | 2016-09-28 00:28:12 | The place is worst ever in all places that I do visit. What it seems from outside is not at all from inside. It's totally a different one and thats very disappointing for me. The hookah was so bad that I just left it after once. It was all a waste of money for me and that too a huge waste as it is very costly as per their brand name , but it's sad to say that it couldn't carry it'd brand name at all. |
 
Monkey Bar | Hardik Daga || Kolkata Epicurean | None | 9516701 | 4.0 | 2016-09-26 23:52:06 | Location-Fort knox building(9th floor),Camac street.

Finally "Monkey bar" has opened its gate to kolkata.After establishing itself in Mumbai,Delhi and Bangalore its opening in kolkata was much awaited.This place is totally a fresh take on gastrobar culture.As we entered we were totally astonished with the beauty of this place.The best part about this place was the swanky interiors and the dazzling view.The menu was mouthwatering and creation of one of the finest chef Manu Chandra.But along with whole lot of positive aspects this place has its negative side too and that is its service and price.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is extremely calm and soothing.The interiors are extremely high-toned.The place is divided into two sections(Smoking and Non Smoking area)which is appreciated.And atlast for this segment,we can bet that this place has the best view in comparison to any of the eateries in Kolkata.

Service-We were extremely disappointed with the service at this place.The staff was extremely confused with our seating.They took about 15 minutes to make us sit and also the table on which we were seated was already reserved by someone due to which we have to change our table in between.We also have to urge them many a times to serve us water and take the order for the food.But on the other side we saw that the staff was trained very well with the dishes and helped us to choose the right dishes according to our starvation.

Food-The food at this place was good in taste but what astonished us the most was their presentation,it was just praise-worthy.We had-
1:Med platter
2:Spicy panner bhurji buns
3:Chilli cheese dragons

Among them our favourite was "Med platter".We also had sheesha at this place which we find extremely expensive.It cost us around 800+taxes.

Food-4/5
Service-3/5
Ambiance-4.5/5

This place is a must visit for experiencing its Ambiance and food oresentation.üòÉüòÉ |
 
Monkey Bar | Ritwika Pal | None | 172912 | 4.0 | 2016-09-26 10:27:27 | Woo another gastropub in town, I was super excited to explore this new place. Unfortunately they not yet started with alcohol. But yes for compensation they have this Non alcoholic beer in their menu card. Which is more like a ginger ale.¬†
Food is awesome we tried Sticky Korean Chicken Wings and Prawn Pil Pil for which is can give 5/5. |
 
Monkey Bar | Manish Jhawar | None | 2238114 | 4.5 | 2016-09-26 00:59:53 | Different menu........v gud ambience.......gud view.........gud food!!

Monkey Bar | Vikash Kumar Singh | None | 32056738 | 2.0 | 2016-09-25 23:21:32 | Went to this place on 25th of September. The best part of this hotel is the view of Victoria + Vidyasagar Setu. Food is ok types. Service needs to improve. Didnt like that much. |
 
Monkey Bar | Shakshi Bajaj | None | 34222951 | 4.0 | 2016-09-25 21:50:03 | Had recently visited the place.  Ambience was really good.  Soothing music and ample space worked well for me.  All the people were very courteous and response was very quick. We ordered nachos,  potato with rachlette cheese and pizza.  The food was yummmm. We asked for out of the menu toppings for pizza and they were more than happy to serve.  It was a pleasant experience. |
 
Monkey Bar | Samrat Banerjee | None | 984442 | 3.0 | 2016-09-25 18:48:36 | Visited the place on 24Sep. A mix of pro's and cons. Remarkably expensive, considering service is yet to reach premium standards. Yet to get a bar license, staff seems confused about where to seat you if you walk in as a couple. While the outdoor sitting layout is nice, it's primarily used as a hookah space by boisterous youngsters, and the seating layout is remarkably cramped. Service also is a minus here with the server not asking or serving water if not called to do so. Portions are quite small against the charges. Chicken Chimichuri was good, folks lovers which was 3 cutlets of bhekti coated and fried was ok. The mushroom pizza was definitely a let down. With 2 soft drinks the tab came to ‚Çπ1650+. Not worth a revisit soon. |
 
Monkey Bar | Abhishek Agarwal | None | 2897244 | 3.5 | 2016-09-25 03:13:53 | Was on the bucket list since it opened... So
We ordered a hookah but it failed my expectations... We tried out the tacos which was really nice... Service was on the slower side.... Definitely a lot to improve..
But then having ur food wit hookah nd Victoria memorial to look over.. The view is breathtaking..
But u need to live up to the name...
Hope to b back soon.... Nd wish to see a Better Trained Monkeyüëç |
 
Monkey Bar | Santosh Singhal | None | 27588565 | 5.0 | 2016-09-24 22:50:00 | An excellent place The sitting arrangement nice with a separate hukka place is very good 
The choice of menu is very good Everything is so so good & has a perfect taste According to me this is the first place where I did not have to add anything Desserts r very good Good Sevice Keep it upüëç |
 
Monkey Bar | Avijit Biswas | None | 1095896 | 4.5 | 2016-09-24 13:18:25 | Kolkata welcomes Monkey Bar with whole hearted love and appreciation... and they deserve it... no doubts about that...

Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox, Camac Street... and I will suggest everyone to go there during the evening... you guys will get mesmerized with the view of our City of Joy... I bet no other gustopub have such plus point till date in Kolkata... they have an excellent intero which you can enjoy anytime... also the outdoor seating is pretty attracting...

The service was top notched... and the staffs are very courteous too...

Now coming straight to the food and drinks...

Monkey Bar | Shourya Sengupta | None | 2357486 | 4.5 | 2016-09-23 21:51:57 | Brilliant food! Loved the wide choice of meat. Please keep up the good work! Look forward to having the Galouti Killer, next time since it was not available. |
 
Monkey Bar | Siddhi Newatia | None | 3761881 | 3.0 | 2016-09-23 21:24:05 | Amazing ambience..very spacious, drinks menu could Hav had more variety..hated the mangaa drink..i found it too sour..the pizza and chilli cheese dragons were good. |
 
Monkey Bar | Harsh Bathwal | None | 1481844 | 3.5 | 2016-09-21 23:42:47 | Visited here for the first time. The food menu is different from what you come across usually in other restaurants. I think it's a perfect date spot as it has a beautiful Victoria building's view which looks amazing at night. Also the music was superb.
Pocket pinch : 600-700 per head. ( Food and mocktail) |
 
Monkey Bar | Shikha Ojha | None | 2112728 | 4.5 | 2016-09-18 01:48:05 | Amazing decor and awesome food. They had an outdoor sitting too which had a big screen playing Mickie and Minnie black and white cartoon synchronized with the songs being played. The cost is on the higher side but if you want to pamper yourself or people you love, this is the place to be. The amazing view is icing on the cake. |
 
Monkey Bar | Utsav Agarwal | None | 31137221 | 1.5 | 2016-09-17 22:49:13 | There is a difference in Bangalore wen it compares to Kolkata one , seriously don't no d reason but it needs to upgrade it very soon as in Bangalore. 
Specifically, the property is pretty old for a brand like dis 
According to me Monkey bar is just not another lounge but a more of a culture which in itself |
 
Monkey Bar | Arnav Jhunjhunwala | None | 22857974 | 5.0 | 2016-09-16 21:28:37 | The best place to hangout now. Food quality is excellent and many of the dishes aren't available anywhere in Kolkata. The key lime pie is unbelievable and a must have each time you go. |
 
Monkey Bar | Tanya Sen | None | 496614 | 5.0 | 2016-09-15 00:44:28 | The moment you walk in to this restaurant you're going to notice the long french windows and ofcourse the most beautiful view which includes victoria memorial. The ambience is lovely, very warm and urban. We ordered Aam Pannas, Tiger beef, Prawn Ghee Roast, Pepper Calamari. All of them were to die for. For dessert we ordered Nolen gurer creme br√ªl√©e. Yumm yumm!! I would totally come again. Loved itüòä |
 
Monkey Bar | Sourav Mukherjee | None | 306717 | 4.5 | 2016-09-14 11:38:19 | Finally they have arrived in Kolkata after rocking Delhi , Mumbai , Bangalore etc. and a few of Corporate Monkeys could muster the courage and had enough stock of lame excuses (for residential purposes only) to visit this joint on the lazy Saturday afternoon last week. Very conveniently located at Camac Street , innovative food & drinks menu like Kerala Rice , Butterfly Chicken , Prawn Pil Pil and many more.¬† Personally I loved the ginger beer. It was a full house and it is nice to see that City of Joy has lapped up the Monkey Bar and the legendary versatile gastronomical journey of Kolkata has just added yet another feather . Must visit joint for foodies and a great place to unwind. Wishing luck and Highly recommended !!!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Siddhartha Chowdhary | None | 211170 | 4.0 | 2016-09-14 00:31:42 | Dim lights and chic interiors. A totally fresh take on gastropub culture. The place was almost full when we entered so 9 of us had to accommodate on a smaller table. They weren't serving alcohol today, and for the next few days also they are keeping the bar closed. we had to compromise on that and had to order the virgins. We had the much hyped 'maanga' which was nice and refreshing. Homemade ginger beer was good. Brownie cookie shake wasn't available. For starters we had chilli cheese dragons, cheese filled cigar rolls with spicy garlic sauce, the sauce was amazing. Rock Corn tempura was good, crisp and the teriyaki sauce was appropriately done. Loaded nachos was amazing. Potato with raclette which was fried potatoes topped with stringy mozzarella cheese, was basic and slightly spiced toped with pickled jalape√±os. We also ordered two types of pizza , roasted zucchini with parmesan and tomatoes and the other, mushrooms with truffle oil. I loved the mushroom one over the zucchini one. But the pizza looked a bit messy and wasn't also evenly crisp. Overall the service was spontaneous and amiable. I liked the overall experience though. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Chopra | None | 34103337 | 4.5 | 2016-09-13 20:44:04 | Monkey Bar is a grown up version of a slightly more casual neighborhood bar. With about 300+ gastro pubs in India it is only a matter of time when people start aping. The Calcutta version is setting it apart from the rest of the so called gastro pubs.

We had the good fortune of going to the private opening of Monkey Bar Kolkata on the 1st September, 2016. It was a small party for about a 100 people. The mood was up beat and there was a sense of relief and satisfaction on the staff who were hosting us. It has taken Monkey Bar Kolkata a little over 8 months to complete the restaurant.

The staff is from all across the country. This makes for some good interaction with them ‚Äì that is if you care to chat them up. The cocktails are more involved. There is reasonable work that is done to create the drinks behind the counter. Work as in ingredients have been mixed and labor have been put in to create a concoction or mixes. Not just opening bottles and squirting premixes in a shaker and serving things up. Almost like an artisan touch. The bases are fermented in house; you can see the large glass jars filled and sitting happy on the bar counter.

To begins with the view is something you must visit let alone anything else. Add the food and you have method to mayhem. The care that goes in the food here is evident when you have your first bites. With Chef Manu Chandra at the helm of the kitchen things are definitely going to have certain standards in terms of flavor and quality. There is always going to be a reason behind why what ever has been done to the food in the kitchen here at Monkey Bar.

Expect massive flavors and good service. In fact it is so good to see the city opening up to the kinds of Monkey Bar. This is a place where you can come in and kick back with friends on a weekend. This is one tree that we two monkeys are happy to call home. |
 
Monkey Bar | Jayeeta Basu | None | 360426 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 21:01:52 | So finally Kolkata gets Monkey Bar!! 
I have always loved the Bangalore  and the Mumbai Monkey Bar because of the ambience.  
First day, the space and the view is amazing!! They had a very limited drinks menu considering first day. I had Toast to Calcutta, Manga and Copper Grin. Toast to Calcutta was refreshing, adding smoke gondhoraj lebu,  it tasted even better.  Manga is something I have drank before.  Copper Grin was okay. 
Let's get into the food menu.  Prawn ghee roast,  Vada Pav,  Keema Pav the menu took me back to Bombay and South. 
I had the Korean sticky wings,  since I already came to Monkey Bar  after having dinner,  I sticked to one starter and drinks!
I am planning to head back to Monkey Bar pretty soon for full fledged meal and lot of Toast to Calcutta! 
Please stock the bar as it is extremely disappointing to come to Monkey Bar and sit with limited choices in terms of alcohol. |
 
Monkey Bar | Arushi Dhupia | None | 1597321 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 19:14:22 | Monkey Bar is on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building on camac. Visit in the evening and if you're sitting by the window panes, you can see the Victoria Memorial, lights twinkling from The 42, and the outline of a part of the Parama flyover. It's so cool! 
The music is good and the place has a very funky feel to it. The food is good, not excellent. 
Loved the pizza and the Med platter.  Corn kernels were okayish. 
The Loaded Nachos were Brilliant!! Lots of sour cream and Mexican beans and fully loaded as the name suggests! No other places in kolkata (apart from the Big Nachos at |
 
Monkey Bar | Shhashee Churiwala | None | 2053496 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 23:48:39 | The newest hub in kolkata with different design and fresco depicting old kolkata. The giant size windows showing the serene skyline of the city. Exhaustive menu with both indian and international cuisine with a twist. Prompt service , great tasting dishes both starters and mains accompanied humble pricing. A great place to kill your hunger. All in all good experience after a long time. A must visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Aihik Barua | None | 1850614 | 3.5 | 2016-09-11 22:10:16 | This review might change. This post is influenced mostly due to the nonavailability of alcohol , and I did see two or three bottles of liquor , anyway , about the interiors and location , bloody superb amazing selection , love it , would suggest it anybody , the bartenders ( coke tenders üòÇ) seemed cocky , but it's a relief to see a high end restaurant serving beef, that's fresh and the it was good actually , would go again for the booze ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Mansi Tulshan | None | 33240285 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 21:17:40 | Went there in the evening today to check out all the hype surrounding it. Guess what! Wasn't disappointed at all. We took a seat right next to the window(yes, I have a fascination for tables next to Windows) and was mesmerised by the breathtaking view of the city. The music, ambience were perfect for a chilled out evening with a great date(note:my husband).
The lemon iced tea was very good.. Perfect in taste. The staff recommended ' the med platter 'as a great vegetarian option and we decided to try that. The platter had falafel, pita pockets, cheese and spinach filos, and the usual dips. The hummus was great and we were serves a hearty portion if it which made us happy coz it's the dips which usually are heroes of this dish. The babagonoush was great and it had a smokey taste which was really good. The curd and cucumber dip definitely needs improvement. It was runny and tasted like buttermilk! Had no taste and we left most of it. The best part of the ambience was hookah had a separate enclosure and wasn't served inside the main restaurant! Will definitely return to this place for a relaxing evening! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sajid Feroz | None | 60540 | 1.0 | 2016-09-11 17:20:01 | New place and pathetic service....guy at the reception refused to give a table coz I was alone and suggested a table outside in open when it was so  hot outside.After a while I was a given a table with no seat n ws suggested to stand n eat (brilliant!) Although after some protest a seat was provided.i even noticed couples were asked to share a table even when some of the tables were empty ! It was quite bizzare !! imagine going on a double date with some strangers ! It was like they just wanted to give table to group of 4 or more ,again like I said restaurant was not even full!

Food was served ..I ordered a prawn dish ,peach ice tea and the snicker bar for dessert.prawn dish was good ,the ice tea wasn't served n after 45 minutes of ordering I was told it's not available .the snicker bar was good (recommended) !! Some how all the servers were lost in their own world ,roaming around in groups n hardly paying attention to customers ..that too when there was no rush at all ! 
 
I am not tat critical while writing reviews but m quite surprised how casual the staff was while handling their customers (that too being a new place in town).I have been to monkey bar in Delhi and tat place is amazing ! 

Service - 0/5
Decor -4/5 (lovely view of Victoria memorial n hoogly bridge ) 
Food - 3.5 (would love to explore more) 

Must have - the snicker bar |
 
Monkey Bar | Aadarsh Agarwal | None | 1183989 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 17:18:45 | The ambience and location of the place was top notch. With the bar not licensed yet the food surely compensated. There is a separate outdoor section for shisha takers. Lastly, the view of Victoria was the cherry on the cake. |
 
Monkey Bar | Reevu Wangdi | None | 284286 | 5.0 | 2016-09-11 00:42:46 | Great place to chill & dine... best thing is they serve beef...Tiger beef was succulent and spiced to perfection... Korean bulgogi beef rice was flavoursome ... chorizo pork pav was delicious... ampanna done right... and service was tops... gonna be back when the bar opens ..I believe next week it is... good going .. |
 
Monkey Bar | Devanshi Powani | None | 33090142 | 3.5 | 2016-09-10 23:54:27 | The snicker bar desert and the Aam aadmi eggs were the highlight of our dinner. Can't wait for the bar to start . Loved the service and the ambience. |
 
Monkey Bar | Jashita Ray | None | 589467 | 4.0 | 2016-09-09 19:52:29 | Had been waiting eagerly for the opening of Monkey Bar and there I was dragging my fiance, paying a visit in the first week itself. However I would say i rather got slightly disappointed. The staff seemed amateur. They were very amiable but highly confused. Firstly it took them over 20-25mins with repetitive reminders to serve us water. And further disappointment was on asking for the drinks menu, they informed us they didn't have license for alcohol. Thus we had to settle for mocktails. The person who took our mocktail order was so confused. He was unsure of the mocktails on offer, we had to specifically cue him with names like green apple or blue lagoon etc. And oh, there was no paper napkins, spoons and forks or sauces kept on the table for us as some had mentioned in previous reviews - we had to ask for them. Probably they don't have them kept in advance in the open air section.
Now the good part - Everything else!
The ambience - Wow. The view of the Victoria Memorial is simply stunning. You can just sit and spend hours adoring your surroundings.
We ordered a teen paan hookah, along with a Virgin Mangaa- Loved it and a Green Apple Soda which was decent, not that great. Next on our list were the Butterflies, Rooster Booster Burger & Chicken 65. The first two were mouthwatering, especially the burger - juicy, filling, yummilicious. And then the cherry on the pie - the dessert - Snicker bar- I genuinely recommend this. Loved the way they serve it and the taste is heavenly.
Overall, had a lovely evening with the MoBar Mojo! Just wished I could give it a 5 star rating. |
 
Monkey Bar | Luna Chatterjee (Madly_Food_Lover) | None | 1304639 | 4.5 | 2016-09-09 01:36:56 | The Monkey has finally swung east, and that too it's making it's presence felt !! After Mumbai and Delhi now Kolkata hasit own "Monkey Bar". 
To start with It's an amazing property that has a breathtaking view. You can just gaze at Kolkata skyline while sipping some amazing cocktails.
Curated by acclaimed chef Manu Chandra, Monkey Bar's menu boasts of innovative food and drinks. I absolutely loved each and everything that i tasted but some of the items and drinks need spl mention.
Kerala Rice Salad- A salad made with wild red rice, blended with herbs and topped with curd chilli, the dish is indigenous and light.
Med Platter-A dish which is a visual delight in itself apart from being a total amalgamation of fritters and dips.
Tikki of Joy- A perfect dish to satisfy the bong fish craving.
Butterfly Chicken- Chicken blended with herbs placed inside a butterfly shaped shell.
Prawn Pil Pil- Perfectly prepared Prawn served with bread. Simple yet delicious
Laal Maas Phulka Tacos-Rajasthani laal mash intelligently placed inside tacos, a perfect fusion food.
Spare Pork Ribs- This is ansolutely recommended for those pork lovers. The meat is tender and cooked to perfection in barbecue sauce.
The drinks served quenched our thirst perfectly, among them some needs spl mentionlike Manga, Copper Monkey, Pink Punch. 
The desserts are absolutely delightful.Gondhoraj Lemon Tart is sweet, with a bit of tang!! There is Snicker Bar whichbis total bliss.
So with the coming of Monkey Bar i can safely say that gastronomic revolution has indeed hit our City of Joy. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anamitraa/The Gut Filling | None | 671420 | 4.0 | 2016-09-09 00:46:21 | The City of Joy is witnessing a major change in the gastronomic culture post the technological revolution of smartphones and wireless technology. There has been evolution of the global food and Calcuttans are gradually getting used to it. After many multinational and national pubs coming to Kolkata, it was the turn for Monkey Bar to refresh Kolkata with its gracious presence.

This 3rd September, I was invited to the Pre Launch of the Kolkata Chapter where the #MonkeySwungEast. It was a lovely happy afternoon where all the foodies, bloggers, critics and experts had a gala time with beautiful cocktails, mocktails and great good.

The place is located at the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building in Camac Street. Blessed with a wonderful view, you can see the Victoria Memorial, St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral and Hooghly Bridge altogether. We had to pick up paper pieces with names of cocktails and sit at the assigned table to participate in games and quizzes. It was a lot of fun. Ambience is all classy with the bar and high chair along with couches. I loved the wall art on the gateway to the open air sitting area which is done with Gupi Bagha, Tana Rickshaw and all the nostalgic memoirs of Kolkata.

The food was equally good. There were many cocktails and I, being a teetotaler had the virgin versions of all the drinks. Some of them were great, actually. We had ‚Äì

Kerala Red Rice Salad - Baby spinach, red rice, raw mango, coconut, peanuts and upmensinkai (salted chilli from Karnataka). I generally do not eat chillies, but this one was so good. Loved it a lot.

Mac & Cheese Croquettes ‚Äì Golden fried broccoli and peas along with chilli mayo and salsa. I am a fan of cheese. So the croquettes were really admired.

Med Platter - Falafel, spinach, cheese filo parcels, hummus, smoked baba ganoush, roasted peppers, olives, with pita bread and labneh. The presentation of this platter was really an eye catching one. It was really good.

Smoked Beetroot and Beans Galouti - Melt in mouth vegetarian galouti on saffron laced taftan, onion and mint chutney. This dish too was okay.

Baked Brie ‚Äì Oh! I loved this dish. Brie cheese with filo surrounded by pineapple salsa. The cheese oozing out of the pastry created all the sensation. Loved this dish a lot. Had a huge share of it from my table.

Prawn Pil Pil - Tossed in olive oil with chilli, garlic and parsley. It was served with garlic rubbed toast. This was extremely delicious. Loved the dish a lot specially for its aroma and the garlic breads, specially.

Tikki of Joy - Kolkata inspired Bhetki fish cutlets with kasundi, fennel seed & coriander, served with mint chutney. This is one classic dish which no Calcuttan will ever fail to love. I was no exception.

Tiger Beef - Slices of steak tossed with chilli paste, black beans, galangal, ginger, bean sprouts, lemon, bok choy and peppers. This dish was a bit spicy, not suited to my taste but loved by my fellow foodies at the table.

Butterfly Chicken - Sweet, spicy, crispy bits of chicken tossed with sesame, chilli, honey and peppers; stuffed in our signature butterfly shells. The butterfly shells resembled to a savoury treat from the lands of Andhra Pradesh, popularly known as Phoolbu. This dish was unique, in presentation and taste.

Laal Maas Phulka Tacos ‚Äì Who doesn‚Äôt know about this classical delicacy of Rajasthan? Monkey Bar has successfully fused this Indian beauty along with Mexican Tacos. This twist in the cuisines creates the beauty of the culinary culture and here lies the skill of a chef, who is an artist in this case. Loved this dish for the innovation.

Spare Pork Ribs ‚Äì Trust me, it is the best pork dish I have had till date. The pork was so soft, juicy and tender that it literally melted inside the mouth. It was tossed in a tangy and sweet sauce which was really good. Writing the review after 5-6 days but I still can‚Äôt get over the beauty of the pork ribs.

Gondhoraj Lime Tart ‚Äì This was one unique dessert we have tried there. Lemon curd, torched meringue, lemon & mint gel, pistachio cake & cookie crust ‚Äì combination of all good things at one go. Loved the refreshing vibe of this dessert.

The Snicker Bar ‚Äì I am not a big Snicker fan. But this dessert along with the perfect swirls of the s‚Äômore has become one of the desserts to crave for at the strangest of times. Milk chocolate ganache, dark chocolate micro cake, hazelnut praline cream, salted caramel gel being the composition of this dessert, I loved it till the end.

Drinks ‚Äì Copper Monkey, Manga, Pack of Punch, Toast To Calcutta, Mad Men. I was in Team Copper Monkey. Had the virgin version of all the drinks. Liked the Manga to be the best, which they claim to be one of their signature cocktails along with Copper Monkey, which was also very good.

I would like to thank the nationally acclaimed figure Chef Manu Chandra to spend and share his valuable words about food and Team Monkey Bar for having us over and presenting a lifetime of memories. Best wishes to the team and may they prosper ahead. Happy Dining! :) |
 
Monkey Bar | The Hungry Desis (Ramya & Chiranjeev) | None | 30569103 | 4.5 | 2016-09-08 16:29:59 | Monkey Bar has finally come to the City of Joy and promises to be a perfect place to have fun and relax. When we walked into the gastropub, the first thing that came to our minds was "classy and quirky".¬†
The best of it all is the stunning view.  You have a clear sight of the St. Paul's Cathedral and the Victoria Memorial in the distance. The service staff are swift and attentive.
 Another thoughtful design is the assortment of condiments and cutlery set on the tables. You can use them as you like instead of calling for the servers everytime. The cocktails are innovative, using a variety of ingredients and the food is lip-smackingly delicious! Our recommendations are the Mangaa and the Tipsy Sherbet among the drinks. With regards to the food, the vegetarian dishes are as good as the non vegetarian ones. We suggest the Med Platter and the Baked Brie among the vegetarian choices. For the non-vegetarians, the Prawn Pil Pil is a must try. To achieve full satiisfaction, do sample the Snicker Bar..it is to die for! |
 
Monkey Bar | Varnika | None | 380228 | 4.5 | 2016-09-07 10:06:59 | The wait is finally over. The moment you enter Monkey Bar, you get the feel of the one in Bangalore. The open air area is simply amazing, the view of Victoria Memorial is breathtaking. 
I loved the ambience of the inner section as well. Even though it has some basic monkey bar elements missing the place is great overall. 
We ordered the MoBar Classic Chilli Cheese Dragons which were to die for. 
For drinks we had the Copper One which was quite bad. It didn't taste of Alcohol at all. 
Taste of Calcutta was refreshing and nice. Pack a punch was also decent. 
All in all once they start functioning full time and properly it will be a great place. Super excited! |
 
Monkey Bar | Roli Vajpeyi | None | 909801 | 5.0 | 2016-09-06 23:07:49 | Monkey bar finally opens in Kolkata! You guys are in for a treat the cocktails are so unique and nice you can't just order one! And the snacks are just awesome. This is my new hang out place. The desserts specially the snickers one is just amazing. |

Saldanha Bakery | 18224075 | (22.5557437485, 88.3580046147) | https://www.zomato.com/kolkata/saldanha-bakery-wellesley | ['Bakery', 'Desserts'] | 


Saldanha Bakery | Kankana Chatterjee | None | 7888 | 4.5 | 2016-12-18 23:51:54 | Its a very old bakery in a lane on Rafi ahmed Kidwai Road. Recently tried their rich fruit cake and the famous walnut cake. Both are rich, moist, soft and mouth watering and melts in your mouth. Never had something so delicious in any other cake shop/bakery. Can't wait to try the savouries they had to offer. |
 

----------------------------------
Saldanha Bakery | Shaurya Pathak | None | 367302 | 4.0 | 2016-12-17 21:09:23 | It will be a time taking process to find this place. But it will test your resolve for the love of food.
Don't look around. Just look down and enjoy the lip smacking goodies. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Kashif Ahmed | None | 1115831 | 4.5 | 2016-12-14 19:10:28 | Surprisingly, this joint serves the best Walnut Cakes i have ever tasted in my life..... It is a very old bakery.... The patties is also lip smacking....
Strongly recommend the Walnut Cake, try it once....But kindly refrain from taking your vehicle as parking is a serious pain..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Amrita Mondal | None | 36255179 | 4.0 | 2016-10-28 21:36:46 | The best bakery in town for traditional Christmas goodies like fruit cake, walnut cake, plain butter cake, plum cake, Brownies, tarts, etc. It is a place where bulk orders are taken generally. It is not a shop or a cafe. It is a bakery where you order stuff and take away. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tuks4 | None | 36484659 | 4.5 | 2016-10-25 00:29:07 | ive been an indirect customer of this bakery for a while.. my sis's school orders their items regularly and i get to taste them too :)
this time though, i went to the place & had my own order.. a good number of chicken & corn envelope & choc truffle cake, both eggless & w/ egg..

my 1 line verdict.. the BEST bakery in the city.. period. in terms of taste + price + raw materials + the care + the old-school process, this is without doubt the best place in Calcutta.. & i repeat CALCUTTA and not kolkatta or kolkutta or some other rubbish misnaming this city gets !
this is the place that makes proper patties, proper macrones, cakes & pastries.. almost all of their items taste uniquely clean & refined.. and someone with a decent palette, will feel the 'non-commercial' taste as well..

i had a client team visiting from Poland who were extremely happy eating these items..¬† chicken envelope is their costliest item @35 a pc.. v filling yet flaky & light.. the choc truffle cake melted away inside the mouth.. super soft !
ul see amul butter being used to fry the onions.. pure almond crumbs being used inside the cake's base.. egg whites been beaten for 30mins until those nice soft peaks show up.. no wonder the taste is superlative !

few downsides to mention.. the cheese puff is not good at all.. slice cakes are sometimes stiff.. the place can do better without being that cluttery.. someone with a nose for hygiene might not be thrilled with all the 'hands' being used.. but i guess that too is their USP at some point :) |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anushka Agarwal | None | 34748091 | 3.5 | 2016-10-24 11:21:12 | Been to this joint lately and loved their brownies and cakes. They are freshly baked and delicious both at the same time. Usually if you go to this place during late evening you'll miss out on most of the stuffs. Pre-ordering recommended. ‚úåüèªÔ∏è |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Debadyuti Karan | None | 5018051 | 4.0 | 2016-08-30 22:52:05 | Kolkata is full of sweet surprises. Who would ever guess that an old yellow house in central Kolkata houses one of the best bakeries in town?! A cake lovers paradise, this bakery is famous for its weddings cakes for the Anglo Indians. Good things don't come easy; one needs to make an effort to relish their creations. A pre order is a must at this 80 year old bakery. While most of their stuff is good, the must must must on the order list would be their almond cake, coconut macaroons and their soft moist dark brownies. If you are lucky and drop by you might find some' bakes' of the day that you could pick up. Debra Saldanha one of the daughters now runs the place and maintains the high quality standard set by her parents. The place is not a fancy store. They know their quality is far better than most bakeries in town and they let their baking do the talking. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Rajtilak Bhattacharjee | None | 68484 | 5.0 | 2016-08-20 22:28:12 | The best bakery in Kolkata. Must try their almond cakes, macaroons, and chocolate fudges. You can pre-order, although there is no home delivery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Indrajit Lahiri | None | 542545 | 4.5 | 2016-08-02 16:47:16 | There goes around a story in Kolkata gastronomic circuit that the best traditional l anglo-Indian cakes are found not in fancy hotels, but in few homes, and over the period of time, they‚Äôve become legends. Many have heard of the name, but few have actually been there, the name‚Äôs Saldanha Bakery and Confectionary

One should reach Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road (the tram road) and find out the B C Sen Jewellery shop on it. While in the afternoon, the traffic moves towards north, it comes on the right hand side. Take the adjacent lane and after 50-100 mtrs, you can find a yellow house on your left with Saldanha written on the outside wall. Parking is a big big problem. Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tisyaketu Sirkar | None | 3479861 | 5.0 | 2016-07-14 13:57:20 | This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Sumit Surai | None | 11641 | 4.0 | 2016-07-13 22:52:39 | This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Arjun Kumar Roy | None | 33434945 | 5.0 | 2016-05-18 00:48:34 | Its an amazing bakery where we get great some authentic baked products. Please try their cakes, mousses and other stuff... Its one the oldest in our city and serves you upto your expectations... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anwesha Ghosh | None | 14295941 | 3.5 | 2016-02-12 19:26:47 | One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Jude Martin | None | 1895578 | 4.0 | 2016-01-26 23:48:16 | Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Suhail Hassan | None | 684685 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 15:28:43 | Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items**** |

Kafe 6/2B | Piko Biswas | None | 410422 | 4.0 | 2015-11-22 11:11:50 | This place is really close to my house, and I popped over with my mom one day to try out some cold stuff. It's a small cozy place, with really sweet quaint decor, flowers, and soft pretty colours, and plentiful lighting, and pretty picture windows. Being really small, it ensured personal attention from the lady who helped us select our food. We had a Tutti Frutti ice cream sundae, and a cold coffee. Service was pretty fast and both tasted really good. The prices are pretty affordable, considering the great quality of the stuff we tasted. I'll definitely go back for more. It's perfect for an evening outing with a few friends, or as a me-time excursion. A plus point is the huge range of Paperboat products they have! |

I had ordered the Garlic Prawn pizza and the Chicken feast with Big Cheese base!
Both were quite good...especially the Chicken one. It was full of the ingredients given, chunks of chicken...and the cheese base made it really good! 
Would like to try out some other variants next time.
At least this chain is better than the some of the other popular ones in the city. |

They have a very informative order status displayed on LCD screens. The seating arrangement is comfortable. I visited this place last week with a few friends and had an array of items.
¬†To start with, the mint mojito was very refreshing. The chicken keema garlic bread was generously topped with keema and the bread had a crunchy crust. The Peri peri potato wedges were tangy and spicy. They were crisp on the outside and soft inside. ¬†The twisted seekh kebab roll is a must try. ¬†The sheekh kebab is rolled inside a crusty bread. The garlic prawn pizza was the show stopper! The pizza was one of a kind, topped with succulent prawns and the lime and corriander added a new touch to it. It was extremely cheesy and wonderful! The Aussie's favourite veg pizza is a vegetarian's paradise; topped with pineapple and cheese, the crust was thin and crispy. Chicken chocolate sweetza is the EBP special chocolate pizza. It was generously glazed with chocolate sauce and choco chips. ¬†To end with, the walnut brownie with vanilla ice cream was a simple,but nice dessert. the brownie was freshly baked and steaming hot and went well with the chilled ice cream. It was a fun dining experience and EBP is definitely recommended. |

A medium sized pizza restaurant and their items are slightly cheaper than the common known pizza suppliers in the city of joy. Ambiance is calm and quite soothing.

Review and Order
‚òÖMint Mojito(9.5/10): This drink is a wonder. In summer days, this will be your best friend, in winter it will last you throughout your food since its cold.

‚òÖVeg Superior Garlic Bread(8.5/10): 4 Big pieces covered in cheese with veggies and garlic essence. A good serve.
‚ú©Chicken Keema Garlic Bread(9/10): This is better than the veg one and has to be, I am 95% Non vegetarian.
‚ú©Spicy Cheesy Scroll(8/10): Looks like a bread but is a bit crunchy filled with veggies and cheesy. Good One!
‚òÖPeri Peri Potato Wedges(8.5/10): Medium thick crunchy potato wedges seasoned with spicy ingredients and tastes best with ketchup.
‚òÖTwisted Seekh Kebab Roll(10/10): Remarkable cooking and palatable rolls. Not too spicy neither plain.
Pizzas
‚òÖ‚ú©Garlic Prawn Pizza(10/10): If you love prawns, you should prefer this any day over the chicken ones(if you have a single option). Make it cheese burst for added taste. The best I've had till date.
‚ú©Chicken Keema Pizza(9/10): This is also a brilliant choice. Sorry, I don't have pics for this one.
‚òÖAussie's Favorite Veg Pizza(8/10): This was topped with pineapple and cheese. Make it thin crust and cheesy. Vegans will love it.
‚ú©Peri Peri Paneer Pizza(8.5/10): This is also a brilliant option if you're a vegan or on your beliefs. Remarkable veg option.

‚ÄªDesserts*
Triple Chocolate Sweetzza(9/10): Sweetness is the king when it comes to desserts and this one, with a crunchy base, topped with chocolate sauce, chocolate chips is a blessing to all the chocolate lovers.

Walnut Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream(9/10): This is also a brilliant dessert option and quite common too, except that the brownie is made of Walnut.

Don't mind my reviews for veg in any review if its low. |
 
(6) Eagle Boys Pizza | Pooja Punjabi | None | 35652799 | 4.0 | 2016-12-20 01:11:46 | I have visited this place over and over again and ordered in their pizzas alot of times!
They serve not only pizzas but also alot of sides like Peri peri potato wedges, garlic breads, keema roll. 

The ambience is cozy and comfortable and the service is really good. The waiters were very polite  
Now for the pizzas, 
I loved their barbeque chicken pizza ! 
We also ordered chicken tikka pizza, sweetzaa (their sweet chocolate pizza‚ù§) 
They have thick crusts with lot of cheese and mayo which I love!
A list visit! |
 
(7) Eagle Boys Pizza | Barun Samanta | None | 35415577 | 2.0 | 2016-12-20 01:06:37 | Many positive reviews allured me to try Eagle Boys Pizza. So, with obvious good expectations I ordered through Zomato. My box contained a 10 inch Cheezy Chicken Pizza, Spicy Cheesy Scroll and Twisted Sheekh Kebab Roll. There were no chilly flakes or pepper pouches with the pizza. So, I called them up and they apologized. They delivered chilly flakes and pepper. Good service indeed. Now coming to the food, to speak the truth, I liked none of the items. The worst was the Twisted Sheekh Kebab Roll. It was a total waste of money. So, not at all a satisfactory experience for me. |
 
(8) Eagle Boys Pizza | Aagnik Ghosh | None | 4808361 | 4.5 | 2016-12-20 00:45:46 | Visited this place with a friend of mine just a day back to grab some lunch. We thought of domino's but as we were passing by this joint, we gave a thought why not try something new. Wala!! ¬†We hopped in.

As per the ambiance, it's like a normal joint and the workers are so nice they Greet us with a smile. And I must say the service is quick. 


We order. 
For dink we had Mint Mojito and it's a okayish drink I must say. And coke.


Food..

Veg superior garlic bread 

*Chicken keema garlic bread 
*Peri peri potato wedges 
*Spicy cheesy scroll 
*Twisted seekh kebab roll 
*Garlic prawn pizza 
*Chicken keema Pizza 
*Peri peri paneer pizza

Both the garlic bread were good loaded with cheese and garlic flakes. And it tastes awesome.

Peri peri potato wedges, sliced potatoes in periperi spices. Crunchy! 

Twisted sheekh kebab roll- a meat roll wrapped in pastry sheets definity giving a crunch on the ¬†outside ¬†with a tender and juicy feeling inside. Loved this 


Garlic prawn pizza - 
This my friend is the ultimate BAD BOY.
Being a prawn lover, munching down a prawn pizza is like I have the entire galaxy in my hand. Everything about this pizza is just so perfect. The bread the saute shrimps on the top, the overloaded cheese just wow! Highly recommended. 


Chicken keema Pizza - chicken, cheese and jalapenos never goes wrong together. 
The base is good soft and definitely not chewy. 

I must say they have so many variety. I loved everything they served.


Even after having so many items I always make sure I have enough to room for desserts. A perfect ending for a meal. 


For dessert we had..

*Triple chocolate sweetzaa 
*Walnut brownie with vanilla ice cream 

Triple chocolate sweetzaa is more like a chocolate pizza except you get lots and lots of chocolate to drool over. The crust was a bit chewy but overall it was nice.

Walnut brownie with vanilla ice cream is always a classic. 

We had a talk with the owner and he's such a gentleman.
Definitely coming back to this place to taste some more pizzas. Cheers EBP ! |
 
(9) Eagle Boys Pizza | Onooshka | None | 5363841 | 4.5 | 2016-12-19 22:15:09 | Visited this place just yesterday, and definitely a thumbs up to the joint!
I thought this is an only pizza place, but I was wrong. They offer a variety of appetizers which I absolutely loved. 
It's located to the left of Ruby hospital towards bypass, easily spotted. 
A cozy interior. 
We ordered ; 
* Mint mojito : which was an okayish drink. It's the usual thing merely. 
* veg superior Garlic bread (mixed veg , mozzarella cheese) and Chicken keema garlic bread : I loved the cheesy indulgence in both the types. Loaded with the toppings and crisp garlicky flavor.
* Twisted sheek kebab roll : personally, this was a star of the meal. A classic meat roll wrapped in golden brown pastry sheet. Crisp and melting within. 
* Peri Peri potato wedges : classic wedge sliced potatoes, with a striking peri peri spicey taste. 
*  spicy cheesy scroll : vegan's will love it. 

Now for the pizzas, you will be amazed by the varieties they present! 
* Garlic Prawn Pizza : hand rolled crust loaded with fresh seasoned shrimps, garlic sprinkles, onions , capsicum and red paprika. Unlike other chewy hard breads, it was a soft base .. and I enjoyed it to the core.
* Chicken keema pizza : again a soft base loaded with chicken minced meat , jalapenos and cheese. A perfect balanced flavour.
* peri peri paneer pizza : with the paneer, corn, peri peri spice , this is sure to be a must eat for vegetarians. 
* Aussie's favourite veg pizza : more like a farmhouse pizza loaded with veggies and cheese. 

Few of th pizzas were filled with mayo within the crusts. But that wasn't quite what I favoured. Nevertheless, they make brilliant pizzas you gotta
Agree.

For desserts now, we got 
* walnut brownie with vanilla ice cream : a classic decent ending to a sumptuous meal. I loved the brownie which actually had ample walnut bits. 
*  Tripple chocolate sweetzza : as trending  this is a chocolate pizza. Topped with brownie batter, chocolate sauce and overdose of white and dark chocolate chips. Though the crust or base of the pizza here was pretty chewy and hard (don't know if they were trying to create a biscotti or not) 

You are sure to have a great pizza day at this place. The owner too was a gentleman to ask whether everything was okay, |
 
(10) Eagle Boys Pizza | Sriparna Ghosh | None | 989836 | 4.5 | 2016-12-19 11:28:05 | Already giving tough competition to the Dominos and Pizza Hut, Eagle Boys Pizza near Tagore Park is making all the right noises among the foodies and pizza lovers!¬†

Went with a large group of friends for a Sunday lunch. Decor and seating arrangements are basic yet funky.¬†

We ordered :¬†

Chicken Keema Garlic Bread: Garlic Bread with keema toppings. When you bite the bread, the mayonnaise will ooze out which is a delight to the eyes and the tongue. Try this one.

Peri Peri Potato Wedges : If you want your favorite potato wedges with a twist, you'll love this perfectly spicy potato wedge preparation.

Twisted Sheekh Kebab Roll : Now, this one is something that you wouldn't want to miss. Strips of delicious Chicken sheekh rolls which will act as the perfect starter and increase your appetite five fold.

Mint Mojito : ¬†A drink as refreshing as it could be. Better than the soft drinks that you gulp while having pizzas.

Chicken Keema Pizza : Medium crust, adequate topping and the perfect amount of cheese....making it super yummy This one is a must-order!

Garlic Prawn Pizza : The Winner hands down. The best of the rest. You will keep wanting more of this amazing thing! Highly recommended!

Triple Chocolate Sweetzza : The only thing that I didn't like was the hard base, which was making it difficult to bite and chew. But the overdose of chocolate chips might make it up for you.

Walnut Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream : Brownie is freshly baked. Tasted good.

For Vegetarians, you'll love their Veg Superior Garlic Bread, Spicy Cheesy Scroll, Aussie's Favorite Veg Pizza and Peri Peri Paneer Pizza!

Service: Excellent!

Price: Reasonable.

Absolutely Recommended! |
 
(11) Eagle Boys Pizza | Priyanka Gupta | None | 36157388 | 5.0 | 2016-12-19 10:15:27 | There are two things in life worth waiting for: A perfect 'Pizza' and a perfect 'Pizza'! Pizza is like entire food Pyramid! Sunday lunch had been the perfect for us.. me and some of my frnds made a walk in to this amazing place!
Eagle boys pizza had been very different positively.. after Domino's and Pizza Hut already taking over the masses!
This place was far better than above 2 pizzerias!
An internationally popular Australian Food Chain.. Eagle boys Pizza specializes in American Italian cuisines.. like pizza, pasta, and desserts.
Location: near Fortis Hospital Tagore Park.
They are located in other locations like Mumbai, Chennai, Pune etc.
The ambience was lively.. with good decor !
The service was quite prompt .. and hospitality was brilliant!
Coming to food.. we had Mint Mojito.. which was amazing with the mint flavour 
Garlic bread of two variants.. veg superior and chicken Keema.. both of them stood perfect!
Coming to pizza we had prawn pizza which was one of a kind.. I have had never tasted a pizza like that.. cheese burst .. hot.. soft bread.. it was a delight to have such a pizza!
Chicken Keema pizza was another show stealer.. very cheesy and awesome..
The moment I had triple chocolate sweetzza.. for the first time.. I was literally licking my fingers.. that was indeed the best dessert I've ever eaten! It was drizzled with chocolate sauce .. and topped with white and milk chocolate chips!

And last but not the least we had walnut brownie with Vanilla ice cream .. brownie was hot and soft .. this was a thumbs up dessert .. I've never eaten such an amazing dessert in any of the pizzerias!
This place is gonna give a tough competition to other pizza hubs in town! |
 
(12) Eagle Boys Pizza | Suchismita Sarkar | None | 2875100 | 4.5 | 2016-12-19 00:44:43 | Have been meaning to check out this Aussie Pizzeria since a few months. Finally went for a grand lunch today with my friends. Interiors are done up very brightly in shades of pink,black and white which gives it a funky feeling. The restaurant is spacious with good seating arrangements. Service was quite prompt and we received our orders still hot. Now coming to the food. We had:-
Mint Mojito and Coke : Mojito was good with a distinct mint flavour.
Veg Superior Garlic Bread: Little round bread disks topped with a few veggies and oodles of cheese.
Chicken Keema Garlic Bread: New idea and totally awesome one. Spicy chicken Keema with onions,chillies and lots of cheese. Hardly anything can go wrong here anyway!
Peri Peri Potato Wedges: Crispy potato wedges sprinkled with peri peri seasoning. Lovely appetizer.
Twisted Sheekh Kebab Roll: Soft and Juicy chicken Sheekh Kebab wrapped in a crispy tortilla like bread, this dish was great. Both the concept and execution was brilliant.
Garlic Prawn Pizza: This was my first time trying a Prawn Pizza. Since m allergic to prawns,I decided to have it after taking out the prawn toppings. It was very cheesy and blended with the correct amount of spices. There was a distinct lemony flavour throughout,especially in the Mayonnaise coating underneath the pizza toppings.
Chicken Keema Pizza: Crispy base with a lot if Keema toppings. This vanished quickly.
Aussie's Favourite Veg Pizza: Pineapple, Corn and Capsicum toppings on this pizza made it a winner. This was quite tasty,in spite of being vegetarian üòõ
Peri Peri Paneer Pizza: Spicy veg pizza with lots of paneer toppings. A good option for vegetarians.
Triple Chocolate Sweetzza: The famous chocolate pizza of EBP! This was every bit as good as I thought it would be. A base layered with chocolate and grilled to make it crunchy. Drizzled with chocolate sauce and topped with white and milk chocolate chips and dusted with powdered sugar. This was amazing! It might be a bit too sweet for some people though.
Walnut Brownie with Vanilla Ice cream: The staple dessert in many restaurants. The texture of the brownie was good.
Had an awesome lunch. The pizzas here are definitely recommended. After today I can say EBP is a strong competitior of Domino's and Pizza Hut. Good luck to the team if EBP and thank you for the tasty pizzas and great service. |

(19) Eagle Boys Pizza | Sabarnya Chaudhuri | None | 32030679 | 3.0 | 2016-12-08 11:54:52 | Mostly I have been to the outlet of this shop which is present in the Cognizant Bantala Complex. Apart from that I have been to the bypass outlet of this once.
So I cant expect a good decor in the office premises. As far as the ambiance is concerned I would give a rating of 2.5 for the bypass outlet.¬†
Now coming to the pizza.. if you are searching for budget hangout place this you can put this in your list. They provide veg solo pizza for just rs 50 and non veg for 72 which is pocket friendly indeed. But I would say the food quality is not good,especially the bread. otherwise it is to some extent good. i would rate 3/5 for the food. So the overall rating is 3/5 |
 
(20) Eagle Boys Pizza | Debanjali Rarhi | None | 31712185 | 4.5 | 2016-12-07 02:00:36 | I liked their pizza and they were far better than the pizzas of Dominos or Pizza Hut.Loved this place.The staff were very friendly and helpful and I also got buy one get one free pizza offer. :) Would love to visit this place again |

(22) Eagle Boys Pizza | Madhurya Sarkar | None | 6309371 | 3.0 | 2016-12-05 16:57:15 | Minimal ambiance. Courteous staff. Cheesy chicken pizza was not so good. Chicken penne in white sauce was really amazing. Takes around 10-12 mins to serve the orders. Prices are reasonable. |
 
(23) Eagle Boys Pizza | Ritesa Chaudhuri | None | 35956465 | 4.5 | 2016-12-05 14:09:06 | Any day better than the other pizza restaurant. 
Just loved the taste and enjoyed every bit of it. Located near by pass ,very easy to go. A few minutes walk from Ruby. Wednesday offer is buy one get one free on any veg or non veg pizza. |
 
(24) Eagle Boys Pizza | Sourav Bhattacharyya | None | 36206589 | 4.0 | 2016-12-02 22:39:41 | I did not visited this outlet. But tasted pizza from a special outlet in our office. Nice experience. Pizza quality is not bad, not very good also. For some time you can taste. |
 
(25) Eagle Boys Pizza | Ashish Chaterjee | None | 36878202 | 3.5 | 2016-12-01 02:31:07 | A nice joint to have pan pizza's and quite good. Their delivery isn't very fast but it's ok. Quality served by them is good but there is still scope for improvement |
 
(26) Eagle Boys Pizza | FOODBUFFS | None | 987893 | 4.5 | 2016-11-29 17:37:34 | This place has been getting some raving reviews of late,so we visited it.We werenot preacknowledged about its location as we thought it to be right near Ruby Crossing but it is a good ten mins away as you go from Ruby towards Science city.It is right off the road,so can be easily located even without Gps.
The service was really pleasant and homely,we felt quite comfortable as the place wasnot crowded and happened to spend some good time over pizza.
The decor is simple almost resembling a domino's counter but the ambience was good with good music.What makes this place score over most of the town's pizzerias is that they donot allure you with thin crust Italian pizza with exotic flavours and ingredients and then charging a bomb over it,there is no such artifice,they serve their own unique medium crust pizza having unique homemade flavours and very comfort ingredients.It is good that they have come up with their own culinary style in terms of flavour instead of treading some already treaded path.
We ordered for small sized CHICKEN FEAST and GARLIC PRAWN pizzas.Pan pizzas were more than a personal size and was nicely baked to a perfect crispness.Mozarella was fresh and had handsome amounts of mushrooms,differently flavoured chicken,some smoked,others grilled with variety sauces adding in the chunkiness.The chicken pizza was piquant in its taste and we loved it.Highly recommended.
Garlic prawn was good but it was a bit too tangy for our taste and we felt that the base was quite soggy and lumpy in places,prawns could have been bigger in their size,they were shrimps but they should have atleast been more in serving.This pizza needs improvement if compared with chicken feast.The first pizza rose our expectations that we felt a bit let down with the second one.
PERI PERI CHICKEN CHEESE SCROLL-It was good,innovative in conception.A flour roll baked with bountiful cheese and stuffed with succulent fresh chicken having our loved peri peri flavour.Great!A must try.
Look out for the led which will give your order status with your name on it like it happens in airport as we search for our flight status.Will definitely recommend our friends to this place as where else do we get such challenging pizzas at such unbeatably reasonable prices with such warm service.
Would go back again to try their pastas and desserts. |
 
(27) Eagle Boys Pizza | Ranajoy Ghosh | None | 36239972 | 1.5 | 2016-11-29 11:47:55 | Visited their outlet yesterday. Decoration is pretty cool. The food was okay types, capsicum was overcooked that's why it's become burn. The Mexican Veg Pizza served with sweet tomato ketchup Inserted of hot mexican drizzle, service quite slow. Overall average experience. |
 
(28) Eagle Boys Pizza | Shoaib Qurashi | None | 36897183 | 4.0 | 2016-11-27 23:08:18 | I ordered Chicken Mexican and Xtrgavanza Pizza and on a serious tone any one going there should try it.. Its lip smacking deliciously yummy.. Though the amount of cheese was a bit less but the quantity of chicken topped on it made for the loss.. I tried pasta and cheesy scroll.. its ok types.. but pizza has a different flavour.. all together a good experience.. |
 
(29) Eagle Boys Pizza | Shreya Chakraborty | None | 4607741 | 4.0 | 2016-11-26 23:21:18 | The first time I came to this place, I was an uninvited guest to a senior's treat. And the taste and prices have made me return to this place time and again. 

Pizzas have always been the truest form of love for many of us, and when they are all the way from Australia, you simply have no control over your stomach. Eagle Boys Pizza is a treat to not only the stomach, but to the nose and the eyes as well (even to the pocket :P) The place serves all kinds of Pizzas, with different offers going on throughout the week. You have the options of choosing either thin crust or the usual thick bread, with no additional costs! 

But the best part about the Pizzas? Most definitely the taste. I claim myself to be a strict non-vegetarian, but even then, I can't help but appreciate their veg delicacies as well. The cheesy layer on top, and all the toppings done to perfection is totally worth the price. My personal favourites would be the Aussie's Favourite Veg Pizza, Veggie Feast, Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Keema Pizza. 

I haven't tried out their newest Garlic Prawns Pizza, or the small bites, pasta but I do hope to try them out soon enough. Among the desserts, the Chocolate Vanilla Mousse however, is absolutely not recommended. 

Overall, this is the perfect place for hanging out with friends, when the budget is low, and you're bored of the other common names like Dominos and Pizza Hut. Totally recommended. |

(32) Eagle Boys Pizza | Mantu Sharma | None | 1012099 | 3.5 | 2016-11-25 02:11:36 | Eagle boys pizza located near Ruby Hospital is a Australian chain restaurant 
They offers great varieties of pizzazz with both thin crust and deep dish bases.
The veg mexican is good in taste but can't compare to the boss in the business The pizza hut and Dominos,still it has great taste to satisfy your taste buds. |

(35) Eagle Boys Pizza | Souradip Chatterjee | None | 3102756 | 3.0 | 2016-11-21 22:42:22 | Not that great an experience. Ordered a take away which they said will take 20 mins, but then I got the order after 1 hr. Not professional.
Coming to the food and restaurant, the interior is pretty cool, nice ambience. Ordered the Chicken Supreme Pizza which was pretty good. I didn't like the garlic bread that much as compared to other pizza outlets, but it wasn't bad. The price is in similar range to a Pizza Hut or Domino's. The variety of pizza available was pretty good looking at the menu, hopefully will try more soon and change my rating into something higher. |
 
(36) Eagle Boys Pizza | Archana Bagaria | None | 1003344 | 3.0 | 2016-11-15 15:32:28 | First thing that I would like to say - KUDOS to the Logo Design ! Brilliant !

Spotted Eagle Boys while crossing the By Pass a couple of times. Wanted to try it out of course since I guess it's a third or fourth outlet after Pizza Hut and Dominoes to be solely dedicated to Pizzas. Plus, Australian. :)

So, the other day, my brother ordered for a veg something pizza from Eagle's. I found the taste extremely similar to that of Pizza Hut's. But it wasn't bad. It was decent enough. Wouldn't say REALLY good. But decent enough to be ordered for the 2nd or 3rd time.

But trust me, after a few months, could feel the buttery, oily liquid on the cheese and inside the bread sticking to my throat. After this particular experience being repeated a couple of times, not really keen on visiting the outlet neither ordering from here.

My brother from Australia had visited me a couple of months back. Was super excited on seeing an Eagle Boy's here. But was highly disappointed with the taste too cause it's no where similar to the originals plus very oily.

Word of Advice - Try making it less oily and more similar to the ones from Australia. |
 
(37) Eagle Boys Pizza | Aveek Mukherjee | None | 8019771 | 4.0 | 2016-11-11 18:05:19 | Went there remembering the spicy pizza I had at Pune from Eagle Boys. But, since my friend accompanying me was neither a meat eater, nor could take even the least bit of spicy, we ordered the simplest of the veg pizzas on the menu, and that's why I was not too keen on submitting a review right away...but remembering how much she enjoyed the pizza, I think I would settle to a 4‚≠ê for these guys now. Will update (probably with more stars, with my spicy non-veg experience) |
 
(38) Eagle Boys Pizza | Alisha | None | 29185947 | 4.0 | 2016-11-11 08:09:26 | The most interesting part of Eagle Boys Pizza outlet is the lighting.  Pizza's are nice and full of cheese. Apart from these,  there are a few reasons which might discourage you from going there.  The pizza takes 40 Mins to be served which almost kills our hunger.  The waiting time is too much and imbearable at times due to the continuous smell of the pizza's around you.  The Staff are very slow but courteous. A good place to visit if you have a lot of time in hand. |
 
(39) Eagle Boys Pizza | Shantanu Ashima Gaur | None | 30436406 | 4.0 | 2016-11-09 13:27:23 | A nice pizza outlet located near tagore park. Prices are like dominos and tastes nice too. Altogether a nice delicious puzza experience. Although you cannot buy a bottle of beverage for dinein (you can buy glasses though) ,but that shouldnt be a big issue. |

(42) Eagle Boys Pizza | Mouli Bose | None | 3033962 | 3.5 | 2016-11-05 21:58:03 | The place is nicely located. I loved the sitting and the ambiance; more so because I sat there beside the transparent glass wall and watched it rain outside. It was lovely!
Now coming to food: we ordered a Chicken extravaganza chef's choice pizza and a cheesy garlic roll. The pizza was good, but I have had better. And the cheesy garlic roll was okay, but I would have loved it if it was cheesier. :3 |
 
(43) Eagle Boys Pizza | Sroban Ghosh | None | 27900495 | 4.0 | 2016-11-05 03:03:01 | If you're bored of having the same old dominos and Pizza Hut then this place is a huge recommendation to all pizza maniacs out there. Probably the most underrated pizza place in the town, this outlet is located very near to the Ruby hospital. They have a promising menu. We ordered the Spicy chicken and chicken seekh with the Big cheese base. The spicy chicken pizza was actually very spicy and really liked it.  The Chicken Seekh had huge chunks of chicken on it. Both pizzas were genuinely fantastic and the most finest part what we observed is the cost. Ambience seemed nice. Staff were courteous. Highly recommended. Cheers.  :) |

(45) Eagle Boys Pizza | Anurag Roy | None | 2410070 | 5.0 | 2016-10-30 21:34:32 | This pizzeria is located near Ruby Hospital, about 5 mins walking from there and is visible from the main road. Ambience is nice. The staff is also very polite and friendly. Coming to the food, we ordered the Peri Peri Chicken 13" with thin crust and extra cheese. We also got ourselves two mint mojitos. The mojitis were very refreshing. The thin crust pizza just tasted amazing and left us wanting for more. So we ordered another small Cheesy Chicken. Just one thing to remember they don't do thin crust 7" pizzas. Definitely recommended. |
 
(46) Eagle Boys Pizza | Shambo Ghosh | None | 746189 | 4.5 | 2016-10-29 21:57:37 | The most underrated pizza place in town.
We ordered Zesty chicken, cheesy chunky and BBQ pizza. Along with that potato wedges and keema chicken garlic bread. The garlic bread was awesome. A must have. The potato wedges were not at all good. Cheesy chunky was truly cheesy and delicious, followed by BBQ and zesty, in that order. Overall, a must visit for pizza lovers. |
 
(47) Eagle Boys Pizza | Anubhab Das | None | 2207470 | 4.0 | 2016-10-29 12:22:37 | since was tired of eating pizza from dominos wanted to try out this joint.. ordered home delivery of their combos.. pizza + brownie.. to be frank it tasted better than dominos.. the chicken pieces were solid chunks.. unlike dominos where u dont even feel the chicken..service is good.. was delivered withing 30 mins..looking forward to ordering again.. |
 
(48) Eagle Boys Pizza | Akshita Chamaria | None | 2465932 | 3.0 | 2016-10-23 09:47:49 | If one is a pizza lover and bored of age old dominos and pizza hut or for that matter chicago pizza....then this place is a must try. After seeing the popularity on zomato i decided to visit this place on bypass near ruby hospital. Cleary visible from main road bit one has to take the service lane.

Coming to the pizza. We ordered for 2 varieties....their prawn pizza which was newly launched and chicken peri peri. Both pizzas were tasty with respect to taste....very flavourful. Base was thin and different. I enjoyed it tgouroughly. However the prawn topping on the pizza was too less. 

Also points deducted for poor service. On a saturday evening  ....restaurant was empty but they had lot of deliveries.....which was already running late. We had to wait for long. The water was served to us after 15 mins. Staff seemed to be less interested. The place is full of mosquitoes. All around. On the tables...water. The Air conditioner was switched on only when we requested. 
All staff were sitting in a room n talking too loudly....so there was no one when we asked for the bill. 

Overall tasty food but points deducted on service and ambience. Can improve a lot. |
 
(49) Eagle Boys Pizza | Dustin | None | 11415361 | 4.5 | 2016-10-22 16:54:37 | The pizzas are amazing. Not bad for an outlet that isn't very old, at least not in Kolkata. The staff are courteous and the delivery is prompt. Very nice service. |
 
(50) Eagle Boys Pizza | Anirban Roy | None | 3107635 | 4.0 | 2016-10-21 23:21:35 | This is one is situated between ruby and VIP bazaar. It was empty when we visited the restaurant. But could hear that home delivery orders keep on coming. The chain claims to be the best pizza brand from Australia. The menu looks similar to the dominos menu sans the garlic bread options. The chicken bar b q pizza was damn delicious. The chicken mexicana was Fantastic with visible chunks of chicken and not processed chicken cubes. The cheese is yum. Also ordered veg Hawaiian which was also delicious. Brownies for dessert were also great. Definitely try again. Only the place is a little downer. |

The pizza's are top notch in terms of quality of ingredients and flavour. Look out Dominos and Pizza hut - you got tough competition ! |

this is the only joint where I found veg pizza more tasty than non-veg pizza.
Ordered veg delight with extra cheese, Aussie's favorite chicken, triple chocolate sweetzaa and mint mozito.
Quality is such that this joint can give the brands like dominos and pizza hut, a run for their money. |
 
(60) Eagle Boys Pizza | Santoshini Tudu | None | 35730134 | 4.0 | 2016-09-14 13:30:27 | A small pizza joint though, but makes delicious pizza. If you want a break from the normal dominos and pizza hut, and willing to try something tasty then this is the place. Yummilicious pizza! One large chicken mexicana was more than enough for two. Must try! |
 
(61) Eagle Boys Pizza | Pratik Roy Choudhury | None | 323728 | 4.0 | 2016-09-03 04:31:21 | Though the pizza is good and unique in a sense but I doubt this is Australia's favorite pizza. I have few friends back in Australia and I have asked them if it is true :P Jokes apart! Pizza is really yummy and different from regular domino's or Pizza hut pizza and their service is too fast like other good pizza outlets. If you are looking for varieties of pizza than this is the place to hit. |
 
(62) Eagle Boys Pizza | Archana Pramanik | None | 34846855 | 4.0 | 2016-09-02 11:31:10 | These newcomers in Cal serve really tasty pizzas. I have ordered from them in many occasions and I must say I am satisfied with the quality. But since I always get it home delivered, the food comes in cold. Also they refuse to provide extra seasoning. Hope this can be worked upon. |
 
(63) Eagle Boys Pizza | Rounak Chatterjee | None | 9558051 | 4.5 | 2016-08-31 15:10:42 | well ordered from here a few days back, ¬†got veg mexicana and aussi fav veg. Both medium and enjoyed them both, ¬†and regretted not ordering more. price is not that high either so sud be a better option young crowd with pocket money situation. if maintained well, this might give the nearby dominoes a run for their money and i would very much like that |

(65) Eagle Boys Pizza | Prosenjit Sircar | None | 1079677 | 3.5 | 2016-08-28 14:01:49 | Definitely worth a delivery shot . They are new and are doing better than dominos which had lost its shine. Almost similar in all of its menu with dominos, there is nothing innovative about it but I liked the quality of thier chicken supreme equivalent and found it better than thier rivals. My suggestion would be to keep up with the quality. |
 
(66) Eagle Boys Pizza | Promi Das | None | 29272667 | 3.5 | 2016-08-26 18:36:29 | The pizza was just delicious :)

(68) Eagle Boys Pizza | Amrita Bera | None | 807389 | 3.5 | 2016-08-24 15:08:48 | The pizza craving got us here on a Saturday evening. Though the road needs major repair leading to this outlet as the diversion from main Bypass has to be taken earlier to get on to service road. So our order was a take away of 4 small non-veg solo combo pizzas of chicken keema, BBQ chicken, spicy and chunky chicken. While the order took a good 25mins to be made, we binged on chicken peri-peri scroll which was nice concept served piping hot with cheese n paprika on chicken. The pizzas were good even when consumed at home. Interiors are nice and bright so is friendly staff. May visit again. |
 
(69) Eagle Boys Pizza | Aman Gaulechha | None | 306225 | 3.5 | 2016-08-23 11:58:54 | Eagle boys pizza a new pizza chain in town. Not located at a prime location but easily accessible from em bypass. Its has a nice innovative menu that can improve.

The pizza I tried was Veg Mexicana, it had nice topping's and was freshly baked, but the mexican sauce on the top tasted like tomato ketchup, sweet and rich tomato's.

The side dishes menu was innovative, I tried:

Cheesy garlic scroll: This is a scroll with mozzarella cheese filling, I found the scroll to be very cheesy. The garlic portion can be increased though.

Twisted panner rool: It looks awsome with a spiral covering over panner sticks. The spices were too good, and it somewhat tastes like famous Rajasthani snack 'panner pakoda'

For desert I choose tripple choclate sweetzza, which is a thin crust pizza with a choclate paste, topped with choclate sauce with white and dark choclate nuts on the top. I found some white sugar on the top which makes it sweeter which can be avoided.

The offers there are only for pizza's and of 10 or 13 inches though not specified in the menu.

The pet coke in the menu is only for take away amd delivery and not for dine in and one has to rely on fountain coke, which was more on water.

For the garlic bread fans: Though not shown In zomato menu but they have it in store, will order it next time i visit there. |
 
(70) Eagle Boys Pizza | Sagnik Sohom Talukdar | None | 1066933 | 4.5 | 2016-08-21 16:50:45 | One of the best pizza in town . Both veg and nonveg pizzas are excellent. Very new in the city, but with the quality they provide it will soon become a hit in Kolkata. There's also some offers on Monday, which results in a certain rush on Mondays. |
 
(71) Eagle Boys Pizza | Prerona Das | None | 31151498 | 4.5 | 2016-08-20 00:34:19 | Well, my dissatisfaction from various pizza parlours around the city got me here. And trust me guys. It was amazing... me and my friend visited here for the first time this evening.... the place was very beautiful and classy.. i loved the interior. Every day they have some interesting offers in here. Today we got hold of the order which says that any medium pizza (10") under a certain variety will be for just 199 bucks.. (extra tax applicable).. we ordered the Aussie's favorite pizza.. well, it was one of the finest pizza i have ever had.. i really liked the way how they serve it.. the pizza was very fresh and a treat to the mouth. Then we ordered a chocolate vanilla mousse. The mouse was too frozen so it was a  pain to cut it.. still it was tasty but not as good as the pizza. Well, an amazing place to have really great quality pizza at a good price which will not hurt your pocket... i wanted them to do delivery also. They do deliveries but within 4 km so that was a lil dishurtening for me. Nevertheless.. had an amazing experience... loved it!!! |
 
(72) Eagle Boys Pizza | Mayukh Dasgupta | None | 3130114 | 4.0 | 2016-08-16 14:23:32 | After searching for pizza joints frantically to quench our love for pizzas, we arrived at Eagle Boys Pizza with a purpose on this Independence Day. One can easily spot this joint with its quirky billboard of white and pink few meters ahead on taking a left from the ruby crossing towards science city. We ordered a 13" chicken feast pizza,13" peri peri chicken pizza(thin crust),7" veg lovers pizza,7" margherita with extra mushroom toppings,peri peri potato wedges,spicy cheese roll,triple chocolate sweetzza,brownie bites,chocolate vanilla mousse and coke to gulp it all down. The pizzas were excellent with generous amount of toppings and chicken which is not usually what we are used to in kolkata barring a few really good restaurants. Besides,we had a rebate offered on the bill since it was a monday and thus prevented ourselves from burning big holes in our pockets. To sum it all up,good food,good service and even better rates. Highly recommended and a must try for all pizza lovers. Thank you ! |
 
(73) Eagle Boys Pizza | Arnab Mitra | None | 1939476 | 4.0 | 2016-08-14 03:54:12 | Eagle Boys Pizza had been in my wishlist for long since I read a gastronomically provoking blog by Shahbaaz Zaman (Foodzpah). :) And only did I experience it last week when I was there at the vicinity due to some personal engagements. The outlet is located on EM Byepass Road in a few feets' distance from the new Arsalan, on the left side if one goes from Ruby stop to Science City. The outlet is distinctly visible from the road with its white and violet billboards asking foodies to drop by. Upon entering the place, I found the set up like a traditional pizza joint with clean interiors and eye-catching violet neons on the ceiling.

Coming to the food we ordered for a Chicken Extravaganza Pizza, Chicken Nuggets, Penne with White Sauce and Mint Mojito. The Pizza was truly extravagant with heart-warming portions of meat, cheese and every other toppings provided, and having it was truly a delight. The Chicken nuggets too was very nice with generous portions of chicken inside each nugget. The pasta tasted good however I personally felt lacking in the amount of white sauce required to make it yummy. The Mint Mojito again was okay however nothing extra-ordinary.

Last but not the least, speaking about the service, the guys over there managed it with a smile on each demands of us which made the journey even more memorable. However, in some cases during the interactions, we found them a bit low in professionalism which I am sure they would work on. The pocket pinch was very low compared to the portions they served. All in all, a good place and definitely recommended from my side if you are a pizza lover and tired of having it from the same chains over and over again. |
 
(74) Eagle Boys Pizza | Chhandak Chakraborty | None | 823835 | 4.5 | 2016-08-11 23:27:57 | Among the stellar congregation of giant pizza joints, those who have glorified their name and fame are predominantly Pizza hut and Dominos. Period.
Time flies....so is the mindset of people!!
In the bizarre of the sheer boredom of the aforesaid pizza giants, people started to look for option. Yes I do agree that even if you have already consumed all the variants of the options available after doing all sorts of permutations and combinations of cheese burst and thin crust breads, you would never say "NO" to a smoke exaggerating pizza slice however, I think just for the sake of "‡¶™‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶¨‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶§‡¶®" , this Eagle Boys got a scope to fly high.
Got a glimpse of their first outlet near Ruby more dew months back and got the chance to experience their delicacy yesterday as they have opened a stall at my Office cafetaria itself. I took one "Solo Pizza" which comes in a 7 inch size, one plate of garlic bread and a pasta in white sauce. All the items were genuinely fantastic..the most finest part what I observed is the cost. All the 3 items cost me just 162 rupees including tax and there was not a single pop-up of "compromise" in my mind after finishing them in few minutes. I think they are doing a great job in terms of delivering such excellent pizza and associated sidings. Definitely a must visit if you are a true pizza lover. |
 
(75) Eagle Boys Pizza | Sayandip Datta | None | 27671251 | 4.5 | 2016-08-08 12:38:39 | The first time my friends and I visited this place, we had to unfortunately leave due to repair work taking place. However, we visited again a week later. The ambience is amazing, although it's not at the best of locations. The food is simply great. We ordered two 10" pizzas; chicken keema and extravaganza, a side if potato wedges and soft drinks. Needless to say, our money was worth and we went home happy. 10/10 would recommend. |
 
(76) Eagle Boys Pizza | Khushi Tibrewal | None | 151228 | 4.0 | 2016-08-08 01:12:05 | I went to eagle boys on a Sunday evening. The service lane leading to the joint was under maintenance, and there wasn't proper markers on the main road so we missed the entry to the service lane, and had to go around two very distant U-turns. 
On entering the joint- it smells very appealing. The place is well lit and looks comfortable. 
We ordered a 10" Veg Hottie, with mushrooms, and a BIG CHEESE crust; a cheesy garlic scroll; a coke (fountain).

The pizza was amazing. It was basically a thin crust pizza with a layer of cheese ( spread like ), followed by a tortilla on which the topping are top layer cheese (mozzarella etc) is put and baked. the pizza I'd not very think, even though there are these two layers. Full of flavour, fresh, not one bit oily- and the cheese was to die for. Has a slight sweetness but that complimented the spiciness of the pizza. It is like a cheese burst in a thin crust pizza. Very different and one of the best of the sorts I've eaten.

The cheesy garlic scrolls were also very good. Flavourful and sufficient amount of mozzarella. A good sider to order.

The reason I mentioned the coke is because they have a funny rule that you can't take a pet (500 ml) bottle for dine in, even though it was on the menu. The fountain coke lacked fizz.

The order was more than sufficient for two people. The bill was Rs. 611, and they don't run any offers on Sunday. So any other day would have been more economical.

Overall, I'm definitely coming here again.

Ambience: 6.5/10
Food: 8/10
Value for money: 8/10 |

Eagle boyz pizza is very easy to locate. Its just beside the em bypass. 
This place offers awesome pizzas which tastes yum. We had chicken mexicana medium size. We ordered for the big cheese which was the cherry on the cake. The pizza had good amount of the toppings. 
The ambience was nice. Staffs were polite. Definitely coming back to try out the other pizzas. :) |

Ordered a 10" chicken keema pizza with big fat cheese as base.  The delivery was prompt.  Got a discount of 20%.  The taste was superb.  Loved it.  Just want to suggest that the quantity of chicken should be a little more.  Otherwise it wont be cost effective for customers.  Anyway loved the pizza,  will order again.  Definitely recommend. |

(82) Eagle Boys Pizza | Soumyasree Chakraborty | None | 257466 | 4.0 | 2016-07-29 13:38:27 | This is one place pretty near to our place, and whenever we want to have a movie night in, this is a place from where we order pizza. We are a little bored of the regular chains that offer pizza. This is where this place comes to the rescue. ¬†However, we have to keep in mind that when you order pizza for home delivery it is difficult to get it piping hot (as in a dine in experience). But the flavours have never disappointed us. |
 
(83) Eagle Boys Pizza | Jessica Mondal | None | 720321 | 5.0 | 2016-07-26 12:26:23 | Yesterday being my birthday and my husband not keeping too well, we decided to go here since it was so near home and we had been wanting to go there for a long time! We ordered the peri peri chicken pizza, and we asked for it to be made less spicy. They obliged us well and were were happy. We loved the taste and we will definitely be back for more! (I am, honestly fed up with Domino's). The interiors are well decorated with a stone pieces effect. I must mention that they have an offer everyday and yesterday being a Monday, we got a 30% off on our total bill. |
 
(84) Eagle Boys Pizza | Aditya Pareek | None | 30372304 | 3.5 | 2016-07-25 21:52:51 | I was bored with Domminos & Pizza hut so I tried this place & honestly was not dissappointed. I dont usually try pizza apart from the two mentioned above bcz other places dnt have what it takes to satisfy my taste buds for pizza, but this place was an exception. Apart from pizza you can also try other add ons as well. Ambience is good & tidy. |
 
(85) Eagle Boys Pizza | Rudranil Pal | None | 362285 | 2.5 | 2016-07-21 22:44:29 | Ordered a Peri Peri Pizza and Aussie's Favourite Chicken... Totally unimpressive. 
We were drawn by the excellent rating on zomato so decided to give it a try but alas our expectation fell flat. I do understand that by ordering at home u dont get that much a hot pizza, otherwise would have had u dined there BUT the crust was over baked like biscuits and the toppings lacked taste big time. I think they should rethink their pizza making process.  :( |
 
(86) Eagle Boys Pizza | Nilanjana Gupta | None | 32327303 | 5.0 | 2016-07-19 00:37:35 | Went to this place because we were damn hungry and could not find anything else nearby and then fell in love with this place.

(89) Eagle Boys Pizza | √Äb ƒÑnkur BƒÅgchi | None | 30029148 | 4.5 | 2016-07-14 09:24:23 | Pizza lover?? Pizza maniac?? Pizza addicted?? If so, this place is a must visit for you. They serve better and tastier pizza than the other pizza stations like dominos and pizza hut... Visited this place yesterday and fully satisfied with the quality of the food. We had ordered corn pizza, chicken keema pizza, cheesy garlic scroll and passion fruit mojitos and each of the items was worth the price amount. Besides the ambience is cozy with nice decor. The price is very reasonable and and I would say, cheaper than dominos but taste is way better than it, that's not what I'm saying, my taste bud is saying so... |
 
(90) Eagle Boys Pizza | Amrita Kar | None | 15662730 | 4.5 | 2016-07-12 14:00:53 | Good pizzas and a good price anyone? This is the place you should go to. I took a home delivery and the pizza was actually great!  Good job boys! :) |
 
(91) Eagle Boys Pizza | Subhannita Guha | None | 34592825 | 4.0 | 2016-07-12 13:51:41 | I liked it more than Dominos or Pizza Hut!
Ambiance is a little dull because of it's odd location, they mostly get home delivery orders.
Service was good except they didn't ask what our base will be. We too missed out the two base options. The thin crust would obviously have been better.
UPDATE: Tried the Cheese Burst crust.. I'm absolutely in love with Eagle Boys Pizza!

The pizzas were soft and cheesy with sufficient toppings. Too good at this price range (added bonus: It was a Wednesday and we got Buy 1 Get 1 Free). I loved the Chicken Mexicana Pizza. The Peri Peri Chicken Pizza was good too!

Always wanting to come back here again! :) |
 
(92) Eagle Boys Pizza | Chandan Saha | None | 14279851 | 5.0 | 2016-07-11 10:55:12 | This Restaurant is very near to my home. Finally tried a Aussie's favorite veg pizza. Awesome in test. Nicely crisp base.

The serving lady Ms Priya not only take order perfectly , but also serve nicely. She done her duty perfectly before, between and after the serve. She make the difference as she know how to take care of guest. 

As per her recommendations One Mojito name Man's drink was fantastic. Nice and comfortable ambience. Very quick and decent service. 

As there is no end of improvements so, out of 5 toppings (capsicum, onion, pineapple, corn, fresh Garlic) Garlic was missing or may be in very less quantity. |
 
(93) Eagle Boys Pizza | Mukulita Ganguly | None | 207896 | 3.5 | 2016-07-10 02:52:51 | Eagle Boys Pizza is a newbie in the pizza community in Kolkata and many of the reviews promised that the place was a fresh change from the usual scene in town. With a Zomato voucher in my pocket, we decided to drop in for lunch one day. 

Our orders comprised of a Peri Peri Chicken Scroll, Chicken Feast medium-sized pizza with Big Cheese crust and a bottle of cold drink. 
The chicken scroll is almost like a small parcel without the flaky crust and has a nice cheesy filling with a spicy hit from the peri peri sauce and red chilli flakes. The quantity of the filling could have been more generous.

The chicken feast pizza is supposed to have three kinds of chicken with olives, mushroom and onion. I found the toppings a bit scantily spread and had much difficulty in spotting a mushroom piece. The taste was pretty normal. There was a lot of big cheese oozing out from the middle of the crust, which tasted a bit more milkier than expected. That was a letdown. 

Nothing was really extraordinary about Eagle Boys' Pizza. Even their prices are at par with the other pizza places in the city, thus failing once again to make this a unique catch. Their service however was quite professional, and the place is spacious and conveniently located near the VIP Bazaar stoppage. 
Overall, this Australian pizza chain can give us a much needed break from the domination of Domino's with some new flavors from their homeland and a couple of interesting sides and desserts. |
 
(94) Eagle Boys Pizza | Sudeshna Sur | None | 34218265 | 5.0 | 2016-07-07 06:24:14 | What an amazing hang out zone with friends! Crave for some good pizza options, just opt this place instead of that regular dominos or pizza hut order! 
Order includes peri peri chicken, chicken mexicana, Aussies favourite, bbq chicken. Whether to name the thin crust or the cheesy blast, both r good in their own way! 
Wonder on wednesdays are the nicest offers among all.
Cheers eagle boys pizza! |

Try Chicken Mexicana, Australian Chicken Pizza, Chicken Supreme......I assure you can feel the chicken pops in your month. It's not a counting pcs of chicken like other Pizzas ¬†do.

(103) Eagle Boys Pizza | Biswajit Paul | None | 34903139 | 4.5 | 2016-06-19 20:35:04 | I recently ordered Chicken Feast Pizza with Tandoori Chicken, Spicy Chicken and Extra - Cheese. It was very delicious and fresh. I would give 5 stars if there were little bit more cheese :) |
 
(104) Eagle Boys Pizza | Koyel Bhattacharya | None | 1030805 | 4.5 | 2016-06-19 00:30:46 | I have been eyeing this place since a long time on my way to office specially after going through the zomato reviews. I was basically bored with the familiar pizza chains. So finally yesterday on our way back home we four colleagues dropped into EBP.

The place is right on the EM bypass. The exterior as well the interior decor of the place is quite flamboyant yet not exorbitant.

Two of us ordered for Spicy Chicken and the other two ordered for Veggie feast. The food arrived within 10mins. The veg one looked more colourful as it contained mushrooms, jalapenos, red paprika, corn, capsicum, tomatoes and it is of Gourmet category. Spicy Chicken pizza is of Classic category and it contained Chicken, corn, red paprika.

After the first bite we could understand the reasons for all the accolades EBP has received within this short span of time. They really have mastered the art of pizza making .The base has the right texture. It was fluffy and soft unlike the crunchy version of its competitors. The cheese was generously added and it was of good quality. The chunks of chicken were soft and fresh. The pizzas were not overcooked so flavours of all the ingredients were retained. It is best to consume it slowly as every bite needs to enjoyed thoroughly.

The competitors now would surely have a tough time to lure customers who have already tasted the luscious pizzas of EBP. |

(106) Eagle Boys Pizza | Gautami Roy | None | 32301846 | 3.5 | 2016-06-16 02:46:05 | One of the better places to have pizza. I had  my pizza ordered through Zomato and the pizza was delivered on time. I stay at Santoshpur and I got my BBQ chicken pizza within 45mins. This is really commendable as my place is about 4-5kms aways from the restaurant. Now coming to the pizza - the BBQ Chicken pizza tasted very nice with ample toppings. This was my first pizza from them. Hope to visit sometime soon and try other pizzas too. |
 
(107) Eagle Boys Pizza | Nitika | None | 1898766 | 3.5 | 2016-06-14 18:08:10 | Honestly , I find this place better than the other common pizza joints. I ordered the paneer thin crust pizza and it was actually really good. The crust was thin and crisp and the toppings were full of flavour. I also ordered their cheese garlic scroll and that too had this amazing smell and taste of garlic with every bite I took. The cheese they use is of very good quality and the crust is neither too dry not too oily. Good place. Would recommend it to everyone. |
 
(108) Eagle Boys Pizza | Arijit Sengupta | None | 29965220 | 4.0 | 2016-06-14 11:23:24 | Favorite place for pizza now! :D Visit here almost once every fortnight with friends and enjoy the pizza/pasta which is way better than any other pizza veterans. |
 
(109) Eagle Boys Pizza | Ayantika Bhaskar | None | 16188567 | 4.0 | 2016-06-12 22:49:13 | This is a popular and happening Australian pizza chain that has opened its doors in Kolkata for pizza enthusiasts. At one of their exclusive and extravagant campaigns in Australia they'd introduced a chocolate fudge mousse that'd received a Gold Medal at the "2010 Royal Queensland Food and Wine Show." The pizzeria in Kolkata is located close to Ruby Hospital and can be easily spotted from the road, thanks to the funky color scheme of their 'pink glow' logo designed to create a fun and upbeat feel for customers. Had their Peri Peri Paneer pizza for takeaway, topped with delicious cushiony chunks of peri paneer, red paprika, onions, capsicum, corn and sprinkled with peri peri spice mix. Apart from being boxed in an attractive black pizza-pictured box, the extremely fresh and hot pizza came with sachets of tomato ketchup, oregano seasoning and hot chili flakes. The name of the pizza in the menu is accompanied with two symbols of red chillies, but the pie is not at all that alarmingly hot or spicy enough to burn your tongue and throat or send steam issuing through your ears. The pizza is loaded with just the right amount of spiciness that actually doesn't mar its taste or makes the eater uncomfortable enough to reach for a glass of water. The chili flakes too arent actually 'hot' as they seem. The base is oh-so-soft and thinly crisp, with awesome meltingly gooey yet tight cheese smeared on the fluffy pizza bread. Freshly made, brimming with paneer nibbles, healthy ingredients and bursting with flavor, the pizza was a delight to gorge on and relish. üòä Eagle Boys Pizza dishing out mouthwatering classic and gourmet pizzas can surely give its major competitors Pizza Hut or Domino's a good run for their money. A du jour pizza speciality chain serving lip-smacking Australian indulgence to your plates! |
 
(110) Eagle Boys Pizza | Ankit Jairaj | None | 2268594 | 4.5 | 2016-06-12 19:29:58 | Move over Domino's and Pizza Hut. There is a new big bad guy in town. Located near Arsalan on the EM bypass, this pizzeria is the latest inclusion in the exponentially growing pizza market in Kolkata.¬†

I have tried almost all their pizza offerings and without a doubt, they serve better pizzas than Domino's. The base is very smooth and tender, the size is appropriate, and the toppings are rich in taste. For an extravagant experience, do try their Extra Cheese option.¬†

The interiors are soothing and the furniture is very comfortable. Service is quick and the pricing won't burn a hole in your pockets. Highly recommended by me. |

(112) Eagle Boys Pizza | Adityarup Sarkar | None | 600499 | 4.5 | 2016-06-12 17:06:30 | [UPDATED REVIEW]

My previous experience of ordering pizza from this place was not a very pleasant one. I had written a review accordingly, and on reading it the management made a great gesture. I got a call-back within a few hours, and they apologized to me for the inconvenience caused and promised the same order, free of cost. They were very polite and prompt to take action, hence the updated review. 
All 3 pizzas delivered this time were very good (Aussie's favourite veg with cheesy blast, veg extravaganza and chicken feast). They were delivered on time, and warm. The quality and quantity of the cheese and other ingredients were also good this time. All the toppings smelled and tasted fresh, unlike my previous experience. The crust was also soft and buttery. 
They took extra care this time so that their previous mistake did not recur. In fact, the delivery boy said he would wait until I open and check if all the pizzas were fine. 
This response from the management was overwhelming and I must say, these guys know how to do business. Very satisfied with both the service and the food this time. Made me change my mind, and now I'd definitely recorder. Thumbs up üëç |

(114) Eagle Boys Pizza | Santam Shome | None | 33221587 | 4.5 | 2016-06-11 02:51:25 | One of the best pizza's ull get in the city,  staff is friendly and decent,  price reasonable. Much better than the other conventional pizza outlets. |
 
(115) Eagle Boys Pizza | Palash Chatterjee | None | 949782 | 3.5 | 2016-06-09 11:23:15 | This was more of a spontaneous plan, although we had been eyeing Eagle Boys for long. Although it is located right off EM Bypass, it is easy to miss. And the road leading to it, is also not quite evident at the first glance. So if you are coming from Ruby, you need to take a left at the signal, just after crossing Arsalan. 
Anyway, the ambience is okay. The seats are comfy, much better than Dominoes.¬† The menu is probably a bit restrictive than Dominoes or Pizza Hut, but the fact that they don't charge extra for thin-crust is great. 
The one thing I liked about this outlet, was that they had a small TV, where each order was displayed with the time left, and the name of the customer. So no more worrying about your order number.
Coming to food, we ordered a Chicken Supreme, BBQ Chicken, and Cheesy Garlic Scroll.¬† The cheesy garlic scroll wasn't worth it. It was okay at best. The pizzas on the other hand were good. Obviously, not comparable to gourmet pizzas, but better than its other counterparts. 
The complaint I have though is regarding the oregano and the chilli flakes served. Both seemed to have lost their flavour. |
 
(116) Eagle Boys Pizza | Rohan Sahay | None | 393923 | 4.0 | 2016-06-09 10:03:41 | Me and my gang finally planned an outing to this place. We ordered 2 pizzas and a cheesy garlic scroll. I liked the scroll as it had a lot of cheese, hehe. Anyway it was a better version of domino's a bit more fresh as well. Overall it was a nice experience. Still not close to other gourmet pizza places. |
 
(117) Eagle Boys Pizza | Anit Halder | None | 29789314 | 4.5 | 2016-06-07 23:17:44 | Wanna write a lot of things...but...
I'm busy eating...shhhhhh...mmmmmmmym

U should do that too. Don't waste ur time reading reviews. Come here, grab sumthing and bite it.

PS:  -0.5 point for the odd location. Actually it took me at least 15 minutes to find it out, after reaching VIP Bazar. |
 
(118) Eagle Boys Pizza | Sankalp Mazumdar | None | 29092409 | 1.0 | 2016-06-06 18:30:46 | Today we ordered from eagle boys pizza for our meal. We ordered via zomato application.we ordered zesty chicken and tandoori paneer pizza. After one and half hour we received it. Till then we were hungry so much we didn't bother to check we have received the correct order or not. After having the pizza we realize there was no chicken pizza what we have order instead of that we received onion pizza. After all this when we called to the outlet for the concern they asked us to send them the picture of it. We did it the same and again called to the outlet MR.ANIK who received the call was not talking to us properly. Instead of solving the issue he is saying "mill jaiga yaar apko " n all. it sounds that how much EAGLE BOYS PIZZA training the staffs. The name he provided to us I think its fake. 
After all this outlet provided one zesty chicken pizza. After this kind of experience I think I won't recommend anyone to eagle boy's. |

(120) Eagle Boys Pizza | Aprateem Mukherjee | None | 649084 | 5.0 | 2016-06-05 01:29:51 | I'm so glad that a place like this has opened in the city! Go try out this place, you'll never want to order from Dominos anymore. I found their pizzas just right on the thickness of crust, amount¬† of cheese and¬†with generous amounts of fresh toppings! Fresh is a word I'd emphasize here. On top of that its cheaper than the other so called popular pizza places! I've visited this outlet multiple times and would continue to do so! The staff are very courteous as well and they bring out your pizzas on time! My favourite is the Chicken Mexicana¬†.Go for the Big Cheese base, the extra 75 bucks are worth it!¬†The only downside is their location as the approach road is not fully constructed yet and the buses drop you off a tad too¬†far from the place, but I think that wouldn't be¬†a problem once the road is widened in a few years! :) |
 
(121) Eagle Boys Pizza | Soumyadeep Mazumder | None | 34086011 | 3.5 | 2016-06-03 22:46:59 | Nice place. The service is good. The pizzas are pretty good. They have a variety of offers going on for almost all the days. Quick drop by en route from college. |

(124) Eagle Boys Pizza | Sreya Deb | None | 8398601 | 4.5 | 2016-05-28 22:48:06 | Had the most amazing pizza experience in a long time. An alternative to the regular Pizza Huts and Dominos we were a sceptical bunch when we reached Eagle Boys Pizza but we weren't disappointed. Rather we're planning on shifting our allegiance to this place even over Dominos. We ordered the Peri Peri Chicken medium sized pizza,Tandoori Chicken medium with big cheese,Nonveg Pizza Duets,Garlic Bread with mozzarella and brownie bites to end with. The Pizzas were heavenly. Literally dripping with cheese esp. the one with big cheese. The quality was impressive and I recommend all Pizza lovers to definitely try out this place. |
 
(125) Eagle Boys Pizza | Raktim Ray | None | 981466 | 4.5 | 2016-05-28 16:56:22 | Australia depicts a picture of mild sun,golden beaches,fun youngsters and music.Eagles Boys Pizza offers u a whole lot of it.The location can be a bit tricky considering the fact that the road adjacent to ut is under construction. 
However the pizzas made up for it.
We ordered Bar b q chicken non veg duet,tandoori chicken with extra cheese,pineapple n jalepeno veg duet and peri peri chicken pizza along with cheese scroll and brownie.The pizzas were too good with a fair amount of cheese and chicken. The big cheese was worth it with huge amount of molten cheese within it.
Craving for the next gastrocnomic experience. |
 
(126) Eagle Boys Pizza | Rakesh Prasad | None | 34393303 | 4.5 | 2016-05-27 20:31:31 | Visited by chance. There is variety of veg pizza . Simply tried veg margherita , size okk frsh and yummy . If u get bored of branded expensive pizza ,try this one . Sure u will like it |
 
(127) Eagle Boys Pizza | Soubhik Sen | None | 311351 | 4.5 | 2016-05-26 23:35:43 | Today I had my dinner at this restaurant. My dinner was on Zomato as they had been kind enough to offer me a 500 inr gift voucher. This pizza joint is located almost on the EM bypass near Ruby. However the road approaching this restaurant is under construction, and barely motorable. It was a pain to reach over there, but the journey was worth every penny. Taste is a matter of perspective, and according to me I just had the best pizza treat in this town. I ordered two non veg and 1 veg 10" pizzas with big cheese crust. The result was mouth melting cheese ecstasies. 
The ambience is good, and the seats are comfortable. One thing that needs a change is the knives supplied. Butter knives are not enough for cutting pizza pieces. They need to supply better knives, the ones that are used for steaks. 
Overall, a wonderful culinary experience. I would definitely visit this place again. Lastly, thanks to Zomato again! |
 
(128) Eagle Boys Pizza | Kashika | None | 29293599 | 1.0 | 2016-05-25 16:10:29 | absolutely horrible..  they confirmed my order never sent it.. after 1hr when i cal they ask fot 40min for delivery ... disgusting. 
will never order again. that is why Dominos is always the best. |
 
(129) Eagle Boys Pizza | Chatterjee SM(Foodfalls- A Unit Of Pooglegyan) | None | 2135434 | 4.0 | 2016-05-24 23:43:30 | In the year 1987, Tom Potter, a businessman of Albury, New South Wales, opened up a pizza & fast food joint, in partnership with her mother Barbara Potter, named "Beagle Boys". Yes, that's what initially it was known to people, and the name was a kind of inspiration from the world famous Disney Beagle Boys. But after a few months of operation, it was renamed as " Eagle Boys".
And since then this popular fast food chain started its journey.
The company was handed over to NBC Capital in 2007, and the current operating CEO of the company is Nick Vincent(2015 onwards). And while highlighting the long journey of this popular chain, it should be mentioned that "Eagle Boys" extended its branches over India also, which includes the Kolkata outlets, currently operating in 2 places. One is at Sarada Pally on EM Bypass(Ruby hospital area), and another is at Bantala.
So far my experience at Sarada Pally outlet is concerned, the unique color theme with pink and black colors contrasting to each other is eye catching for sure, and a reason enough to draw footfall, generating an impulse to indulge in. The ambience is lively and full of energy vibes that leave you in a state of experiencing and enjoying every bit of your visit. So is decorated the interior d√©cor to fit in with the kind of ambience they offer.
The service persons are genuinely well trained and superb at their service. And yes, the franchise owner Mr. Chattaraj, is a person who deserve special mention. Despite of his busy schedule, he shelled out time to attend us to ascertain that we are enjoying our meal and gathering a delightful experience to carry back home. Also he enlightened us with the details of each and every dish served. A superb team of beautiful people I must say.
Coming to food, the starters, the pizzas and even the veg ones, each and every dish tasted yummilicious like anything. Being a meat person out and out, I was literally surprised to see that even veg pizzas can be that brilliant. And off course, the non veg ones were AMAZING.
Yeah, how can I forget to mention their ultimate showstopper dish. The special "Peri Peri Crown Pizza". My dear foodie friends out there, if you have not tasted it yet, go and grab your bite ASAP. Or else you will miss out on a beautiful taste for your taste bud.
But even after all the excellence, one shortcoming I would like to bring in to notice. There are several scopes of improvement in the dessert segment. The sweetza failed to meet the expectations, the way it is hyped. And options for dessert is very limited.
But otherwise a highly recommended place for a delicious and sumptuous lunch/dinner.

Thanks a lot to |
 
(130) Eagle Boys Pizza | Papia Khan | None | 34470623 | 4.5 | 2016-05-22 19:11:35 | This is the Australian Pizza chain opened sometimes back in Kolkata. The place is done up in a very simple and elegant way. The food is good and the staff is very polite. Since they are just a little off the bypass, many may miss this place. Its worth a try here |
 
(131) Eagle Boys Pizza | Somdatta Roychowdhury Bhattacharya | None | 6559481 | 4.0 | 2016-05-21 20:30:18 | We ordered today Margarita Pizza veg and chicken spicy pizza...Taste wise great and extremely pocket friendly.... unlike any other branded  pizza.... |
 
(132) Eagle Boys Pizza | Devpurna Talapatra | None | 507308 | 4.5 | 2016-05-20 20:47:15 | Disclaimer: I am biased towards Pizza. 

It's not very often that I visit the same place twice within a very short span, but I visited EB twice in two consecutive days, which itself speaks volumes about how I liked it. The first visit was for a food tasting event, and the next day when thinking of a place to eat out at, I couldn't think of a name other than its. 

Their Aussies Favorite Pizza is to die for, with its sweet golden corn and tangy pineapple with thin capsicum slices adding the apt amount of spiciness. And make it in the big cheese base, and you surely have a killer combination. This was hands down my favourite. 

Their Crown Pizza, specially made for us, looked beautiful with pieces of meat nested inside the folds of the crown, topped with mayonnaise. 

They also offer a dessert pizza, the Triple Chocolate Sweetzza and though some may find it too chocolatey and too sweet, I personally loved this. A biscuity pizza base with thick chocolate sauce and white and dark chocolate chips can hardly ever go wrong for me. 

Would most definitely order in from them again. And also, I must mention, their service is very good indeed. |
 
(133) Eagle Boys Pizza | Subhajit Guha | None | 32057400 | 4.0 | 2016-05-20 20:45:08 | Having been fed commercial pizzas from the American chains, there's a fresh wind blowing to the taste of pizzas from this chain. One has a choice of four bases to choose from. The guys at the joint guide the dinner with the intent to let him/her enjoy one's pizza and not force sides which others tend to do. They read the diner well and deliver the best pizza. Hope they come up with more outlets! In the meantime, happy pizza-ing! |
 
(134) Eagle Boys Pizza | Mallika Fatehpuria | None | 2087794 | 1.5 | 2016-05-19 15:22:17 | Ordered for delivery an hour back and I might as well have baked flour in my house and eaten. we ordered for the cheese paneer roll, garlic twist and a tandoor paneer pizza. Apart from the pizza, the two sides were just baked flour with no taste in them. The pizza was very average. Would not order again from here. |
 
(135) Eagle Boys Pizza | Avantika Ghosh | None | 34247244 | 4.0 | 2016-05-17 19:52:49 | The place is awesome for hanging out with friends... The pizzas were delicious..but we did have a problem with the serving and had to wait too long for our pizzas to arrive.. On the whole it is a nice pizza junction. |
 
(136) Eagle Boys Pizza | Avirup Nath | None | 33665217 | 5.0 | 2016-05-17 19:03:00 | Honestly this is an outstanding pizza place and the prices are significantly lower as compared to Domino's. I personally believe Domino's makes slightly (SLIGHTLY) better pizzas but this place is still amazing especially when considering the Wednesday "buy one get one free" deal.
Overall,great pricing,great service and absolutely amazing and yummy pizzas.

PS:one tiny suggestion which is actually just a personal lust of mine that I'd like to offer is: consider introducing the choice of something like a LARGE size Cheese BURST crust(like actually cheese burst,not just extra cheese) for your pizzas.I realize that not even Domino's has introduced such a thing and it may be expensive as hell....but I'd pay VERY GOOD money for such a crust choice.I imagine others would too.Of course this is just a personal suggestion and regardless of whether something like that gets implemented Eagle Boys will always be somewhere where I order from frequently whenever I have my pizza cravings.üòç |
 
(137) Eagle Boys Pizza | Soumyadip Banerjee | None | 27343204 | 5.0 | 2016-05-17 01:00:59 | Located a few mins away from the Arsalan (Ruby branch), this Australian chain of pizzeria was on my wish list for a long time.

We ordered:
A non veg duet combo( consisted of four 7" pizzas all with different toppings)
A margarita
A sweetza
A plate of penne in white sauce with chicken
And a coke and a thumbs up.

I loved all of their pizzas. The cheese tasted soo good and way better than domino's and pizza hut.

However, I didn't quite like the sweetza. It was basically a thin crust pizza topped with white and dark Choco chips, drizzled with chocolate sauce and dusted with powdered sugar. It was a bit dry and was quite not the dish I wanted to end my meal with.
So, I ordered the margarita and pasta after these and loved the taste.
Recommended!
            

Update:

I went there again and had a few other pizzas and stuff and I was blown away by one particular pizza : The garlic prawn pizza!

O my God, it was so cheesy and garlic-y and topped with generous amounts of shrimps. I just loved it.

Also Chicken Keema Pizza, Aussie's Favorite Veg Pizza, Twisted Seekh Kebab Roll were awesome! |
 
(138) Eagle Boys Pizza | Anusreea Paul | None | 2257306 | 4.5 | 2016-05-16 11:52:20 | Eagle Boys Pizza was our destination for lunch on Sunday! 7 of us met up and chose the Australian brand to satisfy our hunger pangs.

Mr. Chatterjee, the owner was kind enough to sit with us throughout and walk us through the menu and explain the pros of the place. They are quite popular on the Kolkata circuit and have already launched their second joint!

Coming to the delectable menu, the following were served to us:
1. Range of drinks¬†
2. Twisted Sheekh Kebab Roll
3. Cheesy garlic Scroll
4. Spicy Cheesy Scroll
5. Veg Mexicana - Amazing Thin Crust
6. Big Cheese - Aussie's Favorite
7. Chicken Extravanganza - Cheese Burst Crust
8. Peri Peri Pizza - ¬†Their House Special - specially crafted crown pizza (looked amazing!!)
9. Sweetzza - Triple Chocloate Sweetzza! Pizza bread laced with chocolate sauce and choco/vanilla chips.
10. Chocolate Mousse
11. Chocolate Brownie with chocolate sauce

The sweetzza needs to be eaten before it gets cold, else the crust turns hard. The sweetness quotient is a little on the higher side.
The staff was excellent!! Special mention for Anthony and Priya.

The best part, personalized parting gifts for everyone! :)

Thanks for the awesome time and happy piizzaa-ing!!! |
 
(139) Eagle Boys Pizza | Akashdeep Mazumder | None | 1037739 | 4.0 | 2016-05-14 11:29:22 | I liked the variety which they have in their menu. The pizzas are quite delicious and I would prefer them over the ones at dominos. But I didn't like the sides which I tried. The service was quite up to the mark. All in all a good place to hangout without worrying too much about your pocket |
 
(140) Eagle Boys Pizza | Prabal Chakraborty | None | 1175834 | 4.0 | 2016-05-14 08:28:15 | A place which was shortlisted in my wish list for a long time.

Food- I ordered chicken seekh pizza and cheesy garlic scroll. Pizza was soft cheesy,great in taste. Garlic bread was also good.

Other- I ordered for home delivery.So can not talk about tge ambience. But the delivery was not good.They delivered after 20 min of delivery time.
Highly recommended place to eat. |
 
(141) Eagle Boys Pizza | Vaibhav Kapoor | None | 33478262 | 4.0 | 2016-05-12 23:19:38 | I had the privilige to order from this place sometime back in April, and hats off to the guys back at Eagle boys. 
Briefly, the order consisted of a nonveg (7") and a veg (10") pizza and both of them where utterly delicious. 
The crust was crisp while the base of the pizza was soft (just as it should be!). The toppings just filled every inch of the pizza (hope Dominos beholds this part). Worth every penny you spend on it.
The service was good yet not amazing (via home delivery) but surely not a let down. One thing which is great that the pizza was hot but that also depends on the location of the customer so the service might not be similar.
In short, it serves amazing pizzas at amazing prices. *slow claps*

Do try it out and comment what are you craving for from here. 
Happy dining. |
 
(142) Eagle Boys Pizza | Amal Ray | None | 34465392 | 2.5 | 2016-05-12 22:23:51 | I tried out Eagle Boys Pizza today, but it was pretty disappointing. Seeing the 4.0 rating, I decided to try it. They delivered the pizza about 20-25 minutes after the said time. By the time it arrived, the crisp of the pizza had gone, and we had to chew ferociously through it. Thus I would recommend you this place only if you are within a walking distance from it. |
 
(143) Eagle Boys Pizza | Saurabh Jain | None | 368186 | 4.5 | 2016-05-12 20:11:39 | I am new to the city. Wanted to have pizza that was fulfilling, tasty n different. This is surely one of those places. Crust is softer than that of dominos n pizza hut! Delivers hot yummy pizzas in 30 mins! |
 
(144) Eagle Boys Pizza | Aparna Tiwari | None | 13703691 | 4.0 | 2016-05-12 16:40:57 | Another Pizza chain in Kolkata but this time from Australia. Located on main road at  EM bypass so the problem is one has to make special visit  to  have there pizza. But now the good part is they have opened up there outlet in our office so got a chance to  try there pizza. tried there veg Aussies favorite pizza which   fresh and delicious and the service too is awesome . |

(147) Eagle Boys Pizza | Ashton Cantopher | None | 29214278 | 3.0 | 2016-05-09 12:05:33 | The food was pretty good. No doubt that it was quite tasty and exactly as i expected. For the price, it was reasonable and did not burn a hole in the pocket. However, delivery was pathetic. I ordered at 8.30pm and the food was delivered by 10.20pm. I had to call thrice to find out what was going on. No calls from them to even say the delivery will be late and to apologise. No discount off the bill for late delivery unlike dominoes. |
 
(148) Eagle Boys Pizza | Soham Sharma | None | 2894636 | 4.0 | 2016-05-08 21:49:31 | The outlet is situated at a very odd place. But the interior was good and the staff behavior is also quite Ok. I would definitely like to visit again. The food is tasty and served well. |
 
(149) Eagle Boys Pizza | Luna Chatterjee (Madly_Food_Lover) | None | 1304639 | 4.5 | 2016-05-05 15:23:00 | A nice pleasant joint with lovely decor which serves yummy pizzas. Its really difficult to locate the place and the approach road is pathetic but that is the only disadvantage of this outlet.As for the food the pizzas looked lovely tasted heavenly. The pasta in red sauce was juicy, and yummy. Do try this outlet or have the pizzas home delivered... |
 
(150) Eagle Boys Pizza | Payel Rakshit | None | 378152 | 4.0 | 2016-05-05 02:43:00 | Ever since its inception i had my heart set upon this new pizza joint. Since there are not many pizza places which does delivery and has round about the same concept as Dominos, i was pretty excited. Located at a little distance away from ruby mor, this shop is easy to find. But i opted for home delivery using the zomato online order app.

I ordered a small chunky chicken pizza with mushroom, capsicum and corn addons. With the addons, the price was on the higher side. Now the good thing is the pizza arrived before the expected time, so I was happy. I found the bread to be softer than dominos, which I liked. The pizza didn't taste great, it was mediocre. There was hardly any mushroom(maybe 2 microscopic pieces) and the chunks of chicken didn't have any taste(literally no taste, I'm not exaggerating) . There were good quantity of capsicum, corn and chicken. Moreover they provided a lot of oregano, chilli flakes and ketchup.

I was probably expecting too much, after seeing amazing ratings/reviews on zomato. Hope they will improve. Wishing the team all the best for the future. |
 
(151) Eagle Boys Pizza | Gargi Datta Chowdhury | None | 707205 | 5.0 | 2016-05-04 15:45:13 | Went to this place with one of my friend, the location is little bit odd but for the pizza, its really awesome. The main thing I like about Eagle Boys Pizza is the base of the pizza, the bread is soft.. Far better than Dominos or Pizza Hut. Good ambience, clean, comfortable sofas. Really a good place to eat when it comes to pizza. |
 
(152) Eagle Boys Pizza | Navneet Tulsyan | None | 29816820 | 4.5 | 2016-05-04 14:49:09 | A good pizza place. Taste and freshness - good. Variety good, value for money also good. I will say much better than Dominoes/ Pizza Hut. Their Wednesday offer of 1 plus one is really nice. |
 
(153) Eagle Boys Pizza | Sayan Das | None | 31594911 | 4.0 | 2016-05-03 01:07:42 | A must visit for the pizza lovers!
The place is nice,well decorated. Of the variety of options they offer, i ordered a zesty chicken, a bbq chicken & a swetzza for desert.
They serve you with a smile.
The pizza is at par with the other pizza joints as dominos or pizzahut. 
The price is reasonable. |

I went to this place couple of weeks ago, well it was a nice experience to try their pizzas!
So the place is super neat and clean and has amazing ambience with comfy sofa chairs dignifying their black and pink decor. Soft instrumental music as background score, ideal for big groups because it's spacious! Though there is just a tad bit problem with the location if one comes from Ruby!
Coming to food, we ordered :
‚Ä¢ Medium 10" Chicken Stack pizza in deepdish with cheese burst.
‚Ä¢ Small 7" Cheesy Chicken pizza in thin and crispy base.
‚Ä¢ Triple Chocolate Sweetzza & Coke.
And it was Tuesday they gave us a free Cheesy garlic scroll. :)
Chicken stack pizza was heavenly! Generous pieces of chicken were there in every slices. Actually tasted better than any of the "popular" franchise pizza joints (totally my opinion).
Although I didn't like cheesy chicken pizza much. It was kind of very dry n hard to gulp.
Cheesy chicken scroll was very tasty.
And to end the meal with a triple sweetzza...wow! That was something... Never tasted anything like that before. Marvellous!
A must try for everyone. :)
All of this cost around 800bucks! So pretty economic guys. :)
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

****What's the secret ingredient you ppl pour in that oregano pepper mixture? That f***ing tastes AWESOME!!!! |

Din't expect much while ordering but was honestly very satisfied with the quality. But rates are literally at par with the other biggies so they should really work on it. |

The person who attended us was very sweet and courteous. I ordered for a country style along with a side which was cheesy Peri peri scroll which was amazing. The pizza was even better than the ones we get in Domino's! I personally loved the place and loved the food as well. Highly recommended! |
 
(164) Eagle Boys Pizza | Samarpita Sengupta | None | 29197292 | 5.0 | 2016-04-21 15:19:24 | What an ideal place for pizzas!!...i cn guarantee this is the place serving the best pizzas in our city...i have been here for quite a few times already...recently when i went there which is probably my 6th visit..i took two pizzas..one spicy chicken pizza and one peri peri chicken pizza...i really like the first one..kind of a tangy taste..the peri peri was good enuf!...now talking about the two important parts of pizza..the bread and the cheese..this place excels in both..the bread is fresh..well baked..soft..the ends are not thick and hard..They give generous amount of cheese in their pizzas..even in their normal pizzas...anytime more than the ones of dominos or pizza hut...and for the cheese lovers you should try out their big cheese and cheesy blast types..you will be delighted with its look and its taste..too good!..Now the little not okay parts...i feel the menu is limited..could be increased..some variety could be brought in..then the location and its surrounding..its a bit odd...troublesome to locate...interior and decor is good enuf..nothing great..seating is comfortable...that what matters to me with taste..hence a 5 rating!
If possible visit them on Wednesdays..to make things even better they have a one on one free offer!
U guys are a clear threat to the dominos and pizza hut..keep gng!! |

Would love to visit again sometime. |

(168) Eagle Boys Pizza | Priyankar Roychoudhury | None | 16185334 | 2.5 | 2016-04-20 21:56:53 | I have been to this joint quite a few times and on my first few visits I found the pizza to be excellent, the ambience and service to be really nice.Today being Wednesday ( buy one get one free) I decided to bring some pizza home. I bought a 13" chicken supreme and chicken feast and this time I was quite disappointed. It's 880 including taxes for a pizza (although I got two for the price of one), but if I am paying that much money I expect a little more cheese and more chicken. There was a marked difference in the quality of food.
Rating based on previous experiences-5/5
Rating based on today's experience-2.5/5 (because I like them)
 I have been recommending their pizza to everyone I know, but now I might have to rethink that. |
 
(169) Eagle Boys Pizza | Shreyoshi Mandal | None | 33901255 | 1.5 | 2016-04-19 23:13:56 | Got a Chicken Mexicana thin crust home delivered. It was disappointing, cold and didn't look appetizing at all. I couldnt find any cheese or hot sauce drizzle as mentioned... and toppings too were sparse. Overall it tasted very bland and evn the chillyflakes or oregano mix couldnt save it. Pocket pinch is obviously quite low as compared to that of Dominoes and Pizza Hut but i would go for them over Eagle Boys. |
 
(170) Eagle Boys Pizza | Titli Das | None | 411573 | 5.0 | 2016-04-19 17:19:21 | I mostly order a home delivery from this place, had been there only once. Quality of the food is unbelievably awesome. Even whenever I go for pizza eagle boys are first on the list. They also have some different kind of flavours and they taste good. |
 
(171) Eagle Boys Pizza | Ishani Bhattacharya | None | 29325075 | 2.0 | 2016-04-19 16:18:06 | Well I was very eager to order pizza from eagle boys for the 2nd time but i was very dissapointed. Once the order was here i realised they have wednesday one on one free offer but when i called them aftr the order they tell we dont give the offer when ordered on zomato... So i think I have to take either of the decision as in if i should stop using ZOMATO or ordering from EAGLE BOYS... This requires me to think twice before ordering from zomato and eagle boys. |

(173) Eagle Boys Pizza | Gourab Mukherjee | None | 1053452 | 4.5 | 2016-04-17 13:04:39 | Really needed a pizza place other than dominoes and pizza hut,  so tried this place.  Located close to my college, therefore was easy to locate.   Decor and seating arrangements were pretty good.  Also the boys working there are courteous. They come and take your order unlike other places.  Ordered an Australian non veg pizza.  The crust was soft and it was tasty!!  Plus every Wednesday there is a buy one get one free offer so is value for money!!  Definitely worth a 2nd visit!! |
 
(174) Eagle Boys Pizza | S Mondal | None | 590634 | 4.5 | 2016-04-12 20:38:10 | It was the first time I took an online delivery thru zomato and was extremely satisfied.  Delivery time took half an hour. Ordered chicken stack medium thin and crispy crust and it was just too good. The taste is definitely distinct from Pizza Hut/ dominoes.. The price is affordable too .. I'll surely order from here more often in the future.. |
 
(175) Eagle Boys Pizza | Dane | None | 552151 | 5.0 | 2016-04-12 17:28:29 | superb pizzas better than domino's or pizza Hut and even cheaper. u guys rock! |
 
(176) Eagle Boys Pizza | Karishma Sharma (asoulfoodstory.com) | None | 1169354 | 4.0 | 2016-04-10 22:09:05 | LOCATION & AMBIENCE :
Located on the Bypass ( towards kabsa ruby route), you are sure to miss this place unless you scout for it. A rugged, rickety ride took us to the restaurant. ( roads are very poor here)
From the outside this place looks like an american diner and from the inside the interiors are decent. They have tried to maintain the brand colors ( black and pink) in their decor.

FOOD:
-We ordered for their veg mixed sauce pasta which was not good. I feel its a sin to dump mayo in pasta. ( I am a big pasta snob)
- The pizza ordered was a veg extravaganza with cheese crust. The crust again had mayo in the name of cheese but tasted pretty good. The pizza sauce was tasty and toppings wre generously distributed. Over all a good pizza. Though next time will have it without the cheese crust. But if u like mayo on pizza you may well order it :)
- Sweetza is essentially a chocolate pizza and honestly I wasn't expecting it to be good. I was half expecting the pizza to be loaded with hershey chocolate syrup and some toppings. However! The pizza came exactly how it looked in the picture. Loaded with milk and white chocolate chips and a beautiful in-house chocolate ganache smothered with utmost care. It was topped with powered sugar and trust me, you have to try this dessert pizza!
#recommended
Oh we also ordered for our loyal coke to help UA with the pizza.

SERVICE: The service was extremely good and I was pretty happy with the personal attention given by the staff.

POCKET PINCH: We paid a total of 760 after a discount of 25 percent on the pizza! ( offer going on apparently). So yes the place is cheaper than dominos. ( even comparing other dishes from their American competitor)

This Australian pizza chain is definitely here to stay!
A refreshing change from the dominos monotony!
Who says only Americans and Italians rock the pizza scene? :) |
 
(177) Eagle Boys Pizza | Ayanangshu Hazra | None | 763250 | 4.0 | 2016-04-10 11:06:49 | Impressed with the overall quality and presentation of pizza. Taste wise it is more inclined towards the American style than the Italian style. They have a wide variety which indicates towards their in depth understanding of the pizza making. Seating is comfortable and staff is again very warm. Highly recommended pizzeria. |

Sweetza is a must try.
Just love it here. |

(180) Eagle Boys Pizza | Roshni Bose | None | 32190799 | 3.0 | 2016-04-09 07:08:01 | This is located near Ruby. The road to the Eagle Boys Pizza is very narrow and shaby. However once you get into the restaurant...... You will be struck with the warmth of the service there. The staff were very cheerful and that was something to talk home about. 

Coming to the food, the price of the pizza is relatively cheap than the other pizza joints like dominos,pizza hut etc. The pizzas were pretty big and fresh. But the only thing I did not find in their pizza was a crunchy base. The base was very soft and gooey. Reminded me a bit like my mother's pizza made at home.

Talking about the d√©cor inside, it was nice with a big screen TV which have HD channels. |
 
(181) Eagle Boys Pizza | Madhura Chatterjee | None | 587396 | 4.0 | 2016-04-06 21:33:11 | I was waiting to eat here for weeks now. Its only been a few months since it has opened and its already made a name. So , i had to coax my friends and literally drag them here today. It was a Wednesday , so we could avail their BOGO offer. 7 of us shared 6 delicious and cheesy medium pizzas. Chicken mexicana, BBQ chicken and Spicy chicken. Two of Each. We got big cheesy crust for them.  They come with Loads of toppings sp. Corn and jalapenos. I love jalapenos so I couldn't stop eating. The crusts were well baked. I ll prefer this place over Domino's and Pizza Hut anyday. I have to go back soon to try their other pizzas and the triple chocolate sweetza that i've heard so much about. Also, with the BOGO on, the bill came to a little over 200 per head. Which was really pocket friendly :) |
 
(182) Eagle Boys Pizza | Mr. Goutam Chakraborty | None | 34023719 | 1.5 | 2016-04-03 21:01:19 | Hi,

M a pizza maniac, I really love pizza. According to my financial report and bills in mail (U can check my emails screenshot), last year m spend around 25K bucks only for pizza.

In my area (kolkata 700107 and 700078), only Dominos support home delivery. So, I have no other way to use Dominos Pizza from 2010 but the last few months they didn't pay attention to their customers, especially prepaid home delivery. Last few months, every time I ordered and they gave a hard, thin bread instead a soft pizza. I request them many times to pay attention, but they are as usual ....

So, I want to switch and last month someone informed me that another pizza named "Eagle Boys Pizza" is delivering in our area (kolkata 700107 and 700078) m happy to hear that because m much familiar with this "Eagle Boys Pizza" when I was in Australia. Easily I got it in Zomato and in that last month I ordered 4/5 times from "Eagle Boys Pizza".

Every time they delivered as I expected; good, soft, floppy bread with cheese and toppings, but here comes the TWIST when I order in last night April 02, 2016 (docket no 000-00976). Last night, I was late form office; I try to order them Chicken Wings or Nuggets with a Pizza but as m late, some are out of stock so I have to order Chicken Popcorn with VegSolo Combo. At the time of delivery, I found all boxes are too light like less than 10gms weights and when I opened it, all pizzas are like a paper or some big biscuit and burn, they were so hard, so arid that it looks like thin crust pizza (which I hate so much) above all this, over the phone the store manager or floor manager try to convince me that it was a regular, normal pizza not a thin crust when I ask deliver boy "What it is?" he just keeps silent because he knows m not an idiot what their manager think I am and manager continuously tries to convince me and it was so irritating, I can't explain. A normal pizza dough bread is floppy, soft and 20/25 mm height, but they are thin, hard, and only 1 mm height (U can check my pic). When I try to eat, I really freak out because it was so hard, dehydrate and burn, I feel m eating toast biscuit with cheese by paying around 300 bucks. I try to share it with street dog, but surprisingly, they also don't like to eat as it was so hard. Next time, I have to think twice or thrice or more before I place an order to Eagle Boys Pizza.

By the way - Bestes Gl√ºck

Update : (April 06, 2016)
Next day April 03, 2016, within 3/4 hrs after my review, they again make the 2nd mistake : try to refund me the money; I don't review for the refund or anything else, I reviewed as I don't like it - so I have no other way then to deny the money.

Day after April 03, 2016, on April 04, someone called me from their end. His name is Nisar, he talked with me and understand the whole scenario. After that, today I called him (directly in his mobile) and place a order, again. Love to say that today's order is good as expect form them. In addition, he also added a extra dessert (free of cost), I must say him THANKS for this complimentary dessert.

M also love to increase the ZOMATO RATE for his customer support and handling but not much because a customer support need full help, not a single man's activities. I love to stay with Eagle Boys Pizza in future and if I get satisfactory services from them, I will definitely increase the RATE ....¬†

Update : (April 24, 2016)
AGAIN m really really disappoint form eagle boys pizza service. After April 04, 2016, till yesterday, I ordered lots of time, may be more than 20/30 times but by Nisar (as he told me to do so for good service). Yesterday, April 23rd, 2016, I had guests in my home and unfortunately m suggest them eagle boys pizza

1st - I ordered Nisar and he confirm order at 8:50pm on whatsapp but the order placed after 1hr10 mins at 10:00pm in store (still don't know whose mistake it was).

2nd - As my guest want to get mushroom topping, I requested Nisar and he confirmed me at 8:51pm; but still I didn't received that pizza. Can anyone imagine how humiliating, in front of guest that dinner received 1hr30mins late and still didn't received what you ordered, after confirm order.

3rd - After whatsapp my address and again confirm that address at 9:08pm still delivery boy get a excuse as bill have another address.
 I ordered for North Purbachal, Kolkata-700078 and bill address is Rajdanga Main Road, Kolkata-700107.

Now its clear that -¬†
a) If a customer order by a store contact number, he/she may get 3rd class pizza or service as I received on April 02, 2016.¬†
b) As Nisar promised to provide good service but still he fail and he also provide 3rd class service and support, yesterday.
Now my question is - to whom I call for best or good or at least normal service for eagle boys pizza order ?? |
 
(183) Eagle Boys Pizza | Indira Das | None | 14549441 | 1.0 | 2016-04-03 14:43:06 | Pathetic delivery service! Placed order at 1:10 pm. Neither delivered nor sent any communication till now, 2.40 pm.

Food finally arrived at 3:40 pm. We had to hunt for the chicken in the Chicken Pasta.

Never order from this place. Refund my payment immediately.

Cooking instructions were not adhered to. I had requested not to use green capsicum as I am allergic to it. However our pasta had green capsicum in it. |
 
(184) Eagle Boys Pizza | Soumee Jia Banerjee | None | 9403951 | 3.5 | 2016-04-03 01:04:32 | Pizza was fresh nd tasty but nothing extraordinary. Brownie was nice too. Staff are really good nd service very carefully thought out.
Good experience overall. |
 
(185) Eagle Boys Pizza | Srishti Mukherjee | None | 575070 | 4.0 | 2016-03-31 22:55:20 | So this is one tricky place to get to, though it says Ruby Hospital area, it's not nearly there, you have to cross the new Arsalan outlet on E.M. Bypass, walk for about another 5-7 minutes and THEN you get there. But, I will tell you that all that walking is really necessary to, firstly, work up a serious appetite (you will need it) and secondly, while returning to shed a few calories which you will have consumed. JK. But really, though. 

We went here to treat one of our friends for their birthday, and there were five of us. After we located the place, which looks extremely cute outside with all it's pinkness (yes, I am fan-girling, but no, you will not judge me!), we entered the welcome air conditioned restaurant. We chose the large couch on the left, which is a little cut-off from the rest of the restaurant, and that may have been the cause for the little lag in service in the beginning. But as soon as we made our presence realized (which is bound to happen when a bunch of rowdy college kids are present anywhere), the staff made our evening as comfortable as they possibly could. On that note, I would like to say that they are doing a great job, and they should really keep it up!

Then it came down to ordering what we wanted to eat, after a lot of debate, we decided on our classic favourite - a thin crust Margherita Pizza, then we chose a deep dish Chicken Stack Pizza and finally we decided we wanted a Cheesy-Garlic Scroll because of it's exclusivity to this particular brand of restaurants, or maybe because no other pizzeria in the city at least offers this particular dish, and of course, Coca- Colas go hand in hand with Pizzas. 

We had been informed that in case of someone's birthday, one would be offered a 30% discount on the bill, but on going there we learned that on Mondays they also have an offer on pizzas, i.e, on each pizza you order, you will get a 20% discount, which really is as great as it sounds, and we opted for the latter. 

Needless to say, the food was as good as it looks in the pictures and maybe even better to taste, none of that rubbery, chewy crust bullshit. I knew I had fallen deeply is love. The scrolls were delicious and is a must try, the margherita was beautiful and cheesy and I do not have any adjectives to describe it's beauty and the chicken stack was equally as good. 

The prices are not steep at all. In fact, it is MUCH cheaper than any other "popular" pizzeria in the city. And immediately after I left the place I began to crave for more Pizzas and Garlic scrolls. And I HIGHLY recommend it to all you good people and pie lovers. |
 
(186) Eagle Boys Pizza | Priyanka Gupta | None | 987475 | 3.5 | 2016-03-30 09:07:42 | A new pizza delivery outlet and I had to try this out cus they deliver to my place.

The Nonveg extravaganza that they sent was kickass! Thin crust with cheese burst! Ample toppings and yummy :)

Chicken keema pizza- I ordered a thin crust for this and it was soggy but they taste was still ok.

Brownie bite- The meal saver! Amazing stuff :) |
 
(187) Eagle Boys Pizza | Sampreeti Sen | None | 16075260 | 4.5 | 2016-03-29 08:44:50 | 5 of us visited this place yesterday to treat a friend for his birthday. 
Though, the place was a little difficult to locate at first, we were eventually greeted by the signature black and pink decor of Eagle Boys. 
We ordered a cheesy garlic scroll which was perfectly crunchy on the outside with gooey cheese inside, we ordered the all time favorite margherita pizza with a thin crust-what can one say about this classic?
It was just awesome. 
We also ordered a large chicken stack pizza where we opted for the deep dish base and its mentionworthy that the chicken cubes, caramelised onions and mushrooms complemented each other perfectly, with the cheese bringing it all together.

One good thing (among the many) about the pizzas here is that neither is the deep dish base extremely thick and doughy nor is the thin crust base so thin that it becomes difficult to hold a slice without the toppings sliding off it.
The comfy decor and the hospitable services deserve a high five, as well as the numerous discount offers that they provide. 
We had a choice between 30% off on medium and big pizzas ordered (the garlic scroll and two coke bottles were excluded) as it was their Monday offer or a 20% off on the total bill as we had a birthday boy with us.
We chose the former.

Definitely going back here and here's to hoping they soon open numerous branches throughout the city. |
 
(188) Eagle Boys Pizza | Amrita Roy Chowdhury | None | 8660871 | 4.0 | 2016-03-28 22:10:35 | I visited this place today with my friends as it was one of my friend's birthday. This place is located near Tagore Park. Not very difficult to locate. The place is pretty cozy. Now coming to the food, we ordered a chessy garlic bread which was very nice with the perfect crisp and cheese. Then we ordered the all time favourite Margarita pizza which was also pretty good. We also ordered a Chicken Stack pizza which I loved the most. Perfect crunch and good toppings. They were giving a 30%discount today which made us very happy.
On a whole, pretty good place and nice food. Reasonable price too.
The service was quick and well behaved stuffs.
Definable coming back. |

(195) Eagle Boys Pizza | Indranil | None | 33005767 | 3.5 | 2016-03-23 06:41:22 | Went there on sunday with my friends. Ordered on family chicken supreme with extra cheese, one spicy garlic scroll, and one coke. Took them approx 20 mins to serve..the outlet wasnt crowded but there was only one personnel handling the counter who was taking an order over the phone..so had to wait till she finished the call. The tissues wrapping the cutlery were not clean. Food was good, except for the spicy garlic scroll which was underbaked and had very less amount of cheese inside. Compared to other pizza outlets price was in the same range..but variety available is less. Overall..its ok. |

(198) Eagle Boys Pizza | Sumitava Samanta | None | 5085321 | 3.5 | 2016-03-20 11:25:47 | Had ordered thin crust based crispy supreme veg and chicken pizzas (with extra chicken keema toppings) along with chicken nuggets. Must say we were hungry and devoured them. The quality might not be an 'on top of the world feeling' but good nevertheless. The delivery was in time, after a hassle free online payment and lo!! 
Hot fresh pizzas at your bedside. Hungry Kay??!! üòâüòãüòä |
 
(199) Eagle Boys Pizza | Saurabh Garg | None | 15571182 | 1.0 | 2016-03-19 22:16:31 | One of the worst pizzas I have ever had. Uncooked, cold and tasteless. Garelic rolls, OMG had to use muscle strength to part it before eating. It was the first time I tried eagle boys. Disappointed! |

(201) Eagle Boys Pizza | Shitij Bagaria | None | 1640082 | 3.0 | 2016-03-15 22:04:35 | This place is located near Hotel Sheldon, a little difficult to locate. You can easily miss it. And the road is also not made properly.
Coming to the order, we ordered a Veg Lovers pizza thin crust and a Tandoori Paneer pizza cheese burst. We also ordered their version of garlic bread. The thin crust pizza was just above average where as the cheese burst pizza was quite good. The garlic bread could be ignored.
For the price they charge, its not good enough. But I think you can try it once. And there are a lot of discount options on little. Do try them. |
 
(202) Eagle Boys Pizza | Clara Gomes | None | 6843161 | 5.0 | 2016-03-14 17:23:37 | Best Pizzas in town. This place can give the popular pizzerias a run for their money any day. I visit this place quite often. ¬† You have got to taste their special Aussie's Favourite Chicken Pizza. |
 
(203) Eagle Boys Pizza | Aditi Kanoria | None | 359996 | 5.0 | 2016-03-14 15:19:38 | The Best ever pizza I have ever had. Perfectly baked with the perfect base and amazing toppings. The ambience is happy with nice music. I was soo full after the medium pizza I had but still ordered for another mini. Just a Lil tough to locate. |
 
(204) Eagle Boys Pizza | Md Aquib | None | 1407822 | 3.5 | 2016-03-14 11:53:00 | After seeing the good reviews on zomato I've decided to checkout this place..

I've ordered Zesty Chicken Pizza and Thumbs Up..The Zesty Chicken was ok but it does not match the quality and superior taste as compare to Pizza Hut and Dominos..

The interiors of Eagle Boys Pizza is very good..It gives you the feeling of perfect hangout place with your friends.. The cherry pink and white colour themed is well suited..

It also has a LED TV where you can watch matches with your friends that's I think is an advantage of this pizza restaurant..

Another advantage of this pizza restaurant is that you go the counter, order your food and sit comfortably and wait for your order.. As they serve your order..Moreover,you can also view your name and expected serving time in the LCD display TV so you are well updated..

If you are a Pizza Hut and Dominos lover then this is not a cup of tea for you..But if you loves to hangout to new places then you can surely come and have a nice time over here.. |
 
(205) Eagle Boys Pizza | Utsab Banerjee | None | 11959561 | 5.0 | 2016-03-11 20:02:37 | Overpriced pizza joints days are over with this awesome place who serve lip smacking fresh pizza's. Their pizza's tastes amazing and the best part it the prices are very reasonable(specially with their offers). We ordered supreme and extravaganza and we could not decide which one was better as we were too engrossed in their taste. Four 13" double chicken topping filled pizzas with four cold drinks came at 2500. 
Last but definitely not the least their sweetza is a bliss. Never did i think that hot chocolate in pizza can taste this amazing. Definitely try this,its worth it.
The decor is pretty cool with big comfy chairs and extremely courteous staff. This place is sure to become a big time hit.
The location might not be very convenient for many but its worth the travel,cause the pizzas are going blow you away.
They have some amazing offers as well,make sure you check them.
Will be visiting pretty soon again.üòäüòä |
 
(206) Eagle Boys Pizza | Sneha Ghosh | None | 10215161 | 5.0 | 2016-03-10 22:57:33 | Dominos and pizza hut surely have to take a back seat now that Eagle Boys Pizza is here. Ordered chicken supreme and chicken extravaganza. The pizzas had just the right amount of cheese, chicken and spice and were absolutely lip smacking. Last but not the least, the chocolate pizza or the sweetza, we ordered for dessert was a real delight. The decor is likeable too. Eagerly wanting to make the next visit. |
 
(207) Eagle Boys Pizza | Debdutta Ghosh | None | 1067318 | 4.0 | 2016-03-10 19:01:51 | Had my eyes on this relatively new pizza parlor for quite some time. Digging up a little, I found that Eagle Boys Pizza has an Aussie origin and their franchise has outlets in few Indian cities like Hyderabad and Delhi. Their only outlet in Kolkata is this one, I am reviewing. In this review, I would be heavily comparing them with Domino's (Yes, our old loyal Domino's) as I have been their regular customer since ages.

First off, their outlet is not really publicized much. If you don't know them, it's really hard for you to know them. The outlet itself is located somewhere off E.M. Bypass, near Tagore Park I believe. I never received any pamphlets in newspapers whereas Domino's would send them almost every week.

Now coming to the meal, I ordered a 13" Chicken Supreme Pizza, Chicken Penne Pasta and Cheesy Garlic Scroll. The order was placed using Zomato and I got a generous discount of 20% on the bill :) The Penne Pasta was replaced with Macaroni Pasta as they had run out of stock on that one.

Chicken Supreme Pizza was quite different from Dominos' variant of the same name. It was less spicier, more cheesier and what to say about the taste, super delightful. Toppings were not excessive, neither very less (about 5-6 chicken pieces per slice). The crust was nice and soft. The pizza was bigger than I had expected, at least an inch bigger than Domino's largest size.

Coming to sides, Cheesy Garlic Scroll was nice, cheese oozing out of it (see the photo). Macaroni Pasta was a disappointment, sauce was not good and it was excessively oily. Oregano and Chilli seasoning sachets was provided.

Pricing is economical, all the above items cost me ‚Çπ795 after discount. At Domino's I easily manage to spend over ‚Çπ1000 if I have no discount coupons around. Packing was okay but a bit unprofessional, pasta and garlic scroll came packed in generic tin foil boxes, no branding on them whatsoever. Bill was totally unprofessional, a handwritten bill. Yes! Handwritten bill, can you imagine in this era. Even most small-scale restaurants nowadays provide a printed bill. Service was a bit unprofessional as well, they called like four times, first to confirm the order, second as they forgot to ask for the sauce in pasta, third to tell that pasta of made choice is not available (great) and lastly to know about the delivery address. Delivery took 45 minutes, and no, they don't have any 30 minutes or free policy.

Narrowing down everything you are looking at a truly good Pizza joint, a great alternative to Domino's. Two suggestions for them, first increase the service efficiency and second, introduce some good sides/appetizers, that section seems to be very empty right now. |

I wud rate it 2! The person on phone does NOT know where exactly is this cafe located..
He himself was sounding so confused and misguided me as well. |
 
(209) Eagle Boys Pizza | Projjal Datta | None | 2540256 | 4.5 | 2016-03-09 15:08:28 | I have not been to this restaurant so cannot speak much about the ambience, look and feel etc. But their Pizza's were really great. Its a must visit. The delivery was made within 30mins. |
 
(210) Eagle Boys Pizza | VISHAL SAHA | None | 31140716 | 4.0 | 2016-03-09 13:20:54 | I have ordered online from this place, really loved the freshness of the pizza. the quality and quantity is far better then any other pizza. and the desert item Sweetzza is absolutely mouth watering. We'll visit again soon to have some more new items. thanks a lot to serve such mouth watering pizzas in quite reasonable price. |
 
(211) Eagle Boys Pizza | Krishanu Das | None | 16596358 | 4.0 | 2016-03-07 02:03:53 | Visited this outlet near Ruby today on Asia cup final... A bit difficult to locate even if it can be seen from the bypass it's just opposite to shimla biriyani... Its a mid size outlet with a good amount of sitting capacity clean and well settled.. Nice ambience as well... 
We ordered Veg corn pizza and spicy chicken pizza with thin crust bread ... Wid coke... I must say they are really good at taste and quality.. The thin crust pizza was absolute delight which was some what I expected ...but the veg pizza was super good which was nt expected but a complete surprise for us... All in all I loved them a lot and would love to visit them again ... :D  Pizza lovers must try them :) |
 
(212) Eagle Boys Pizza | Soumick Mitra | None | 5065421 | 4.5 | 2016-03-04 17:23:10 | It ws my first time experience at EB pizza.......it ws worth what we paid fr ...we had zesty chickn and spicy chikn........the place also runs sm gud offrs time to time....found the place pockt frndly compared to othr pizza outlets.... |
 
(213) Eagle Boys Pizza | Chitrak Pal | None | 1144019 | 4.0 | 2016-02-29 11:36:07 | When the city is after the renowned brands of pizza, EB pizza stands on its own with different taste, better base and extra delicious topping. Loved the first experience of EB. And would recommend their sweetzaa, the pizza wit chocolate topping. Blown my mind. So would rate 4.0 for food, 4.0 for deliver on time and 4.0 for the experience. Keeping 1.0 in my reserve for the next experience at EB |
 
(214) Eagle Boys Pizza | Anindita Paul | None | 3030914 | 5.0 | 2016-02-25 21:37:39 | To discover a hidden pizza nook amongst the grey , concrete jungle that is Ruby hospital area and to find that it houses some of the best pizzas in Kolkata will surely make you feel like a Bedouin at an oasis . Eagle Boys pizza , with the right marketing , holds the promise to become the next best pizza eatery in the city. With delicacies  like the chocolate sweetza ( chocolate pizza generously coated with hot chocolate syrup and white and brown choco chips) , Chicken Mexicana pizza , Chicken bundi pizza , Extravaganza pizza -the list is long , my friends and I had a ball. The staff is well trained hospitable and courteous, making your visit memorable by offering to click your pictures and featuring in their blogs. Ther business mantra is smart - hosting attractive offers every day of the week till now. ( We went on a Wednesday and availed buy 1 get 1 ). Before winding up , I'd ask all Jerry mice to give this place a swirl ! |
 
(215) Eagle Boys Pizza | Kimaya Banerjee | None | 2166698 | 4.0 | 2016-02-25 16:45:08 | Their pizza is fantastic- they make especially gold thin crust pizzas. The toppings are generous, the cheese nice and stringy like nowhere else. I only wish they would deliver in a wider radius- their location is rather inconvenient. If they do, they'd give every other pizza joint in town a run for their money. |
 
(216) Eagle Boys Pizza | Sharmistha Paul | None | 27482233 | 4.0 | 2016-02-25 14:41:54 | The best pizzas I have eaten till date!!!!.We had one mexicana chicken pizza along with one extravaganza chicken pizza.Both of them were amazing!The quantity is good enough.There were six of us ,so we had medium size pizzas.To top it there was a buy one get one free offer!!We ended with a Tripple chocolate sweetza which was soft,delicious and full of chocolate!
Overall I loved the food as well as the place.The staff is good as well.What more do you need!! |
 
(217) Eagle Boys Pizza | Pritha Ghosh | None | 209377 | 4.5 | 2016-02-24 18:46:45 | Visited this place today.  Since it's a Wednesday, we could avail the buy 1 get 1 free offer on the pizzas. We ordered a large bar-b-q pizza and a spicy chicken pizza. Both the pizzas were really delicious but the bar-b-q pizza was everyone's favorite. We also tried the garlic bread and the triple chocolate sweetza. I've read a lot of reviews which said that the chocolate pizza was too sweet but for me, it was heavenly. A perfect end to a delicious meal. This is the place I will be visiting for all my pizza cravings :D |
 
(218) Eagle Boys Pizza | Protik Basu | None | 2226392 | 3.0 | 2016-02-22 13:54:37 | pizzas are decent but approach road is poor & under construction and restaurant is full of flies and mosquitoes |
 
(219) Eagle Boys Pizza | Satarupa Chakraborty | None | 725549 | 3.0 | 2016-02-22 09:24:19 | After going thoroughly with the reviews in zomato I finally decided to visit eagle boys pizza. As I am a frequent customer of dominos pizza I certainly found some similarities with the menu n pricing. I had ordered for extravaganza nonveg pizza and coke. Crust was soft and it was quite tasty. But I felt it was too oily and here it differs from dominos pizza. |
 
(220) Eagle Boys Pizza | Subhojyoti Dasgupta | None | 131132 | 2.0 | 2016-02-21 15:15:11 | Let me be blatantly honest- it's even worse than domino's. If you think domino's is bad try this to redefine your lowest bar. Just not worth it |
 
(221) Eagle Boys Pizza | Manoj Mohta | None | 9830971 | 4.0 | 2016-02-20 22:50:30 | Excellent preparation  but the quality of ketchup was a not up to the mark. The thin crust pizzas are excellent and so are the desserts must  try the veg extravaganza . |
 
(222) Eagle Boys Pizza | Abhigyan Ghose | None | 1986698 | 3.0 | 2016-02-20 22:17:57 | so this time I've visited a newly opened pizza eatery.this restaurant is on EMBYEPASS.Just after crossing the SHELDON HOTEL take the left turn & you'll locate this eatery.Car parking will not be a problem here,Okay so i had a chicken extravaganza pizza followed by a bottle of coke. Decoration was nice & clean with a moderate sitting option.Pizza was neither too much tasty neither very bad.It was very just like okay.I found this pizza a little too oily.I could easily figure out the numbers of chicken chunk.I could find a resemblance with DOMINOS in term of pricing. |
 
(223) Eagle Boys Pizza | Debdutta Das | None | 11515821 | 4.5 | 2016-02-19 19:10:12 | Finally visited this one after a long time with my childhood friend. We orderd one chicken n corn and another tandoori paneer. I liked the former one much more than the paneer one..but both the pizzas were so delicious. The ambience was quite soothing and also the servicing was pretty fast. Hope to visit this one soon with friends :-D |
 
(224) Eagle Boys Pizza | Anwesha Das | None | 1319715 | 4.0 | 2016-02-18 21:43:35 | This is the new den for pizzas now. Being near my college, I have become a frequent visitor here. On Wednesdays they have an offer of 'buy one get one free' available on any pizzas of 10 or 13 inches. I have tasted almost all the pizzas here. Stack Chicken, Chicken Mexicana are my favourites here. The desserts are also quite delicious. Sweetza, a chocolate pizza deserves special mention. The only thing I didn't like here is the chicken wings. Would love to go and taste the other pizzas on the menu. :P |
 
(225) Eagle Boys Pizza | Pawan Agarwal | None | 33588477 | 1.0 | 2016-02-17 21:50:56 | I have ordered pizza many a times from them.but this time absolutely disappointed. The pizza was absolutely cold,it was inedible. Seriously dissatisfied with the service. |
 
(226) Eagle Boys Pizza | Avantika Agarwal | None | 33588304 | 1.0 | 2016-02-17 21:31:56 | Terrible service.late delirvery!the pizza was absolutely cold!even after you specifically mention your requirements they dont bother!absolutely uneatable! |
 
(227) Eagle Boys Pizza | Edward D'Castro | None | 51417 | 3.5 | 2016-02-16 03:13:09 | I have ordered twice from Eagle Boys and that defintely says that the food is good. The first time, it was a take away and they were prompt. The quality of the pizza is good and there is enough material on the base to eat. The second time around, I decided to dine in. Again, I ordered a pizza which I relished. The only problem I had was with the chicken wings. What I actually got was chicken drumsticks. Also from a place that adverstises itself as Australian, the drumsticks were definitely north Indian in style. The plate was also garnished with sliced onion and tomato. Defintely not Australian like. Having said that however, they did taste good. I will definitely visit them again but maybe I will just stick to the pizzas. |
 
(228) Eagle Boys Pizza | Anupam Mukhopadhyay | None | 33559509 | 4.5 | 2016-02-15 01:05:46 | I have seen this outlet quite a few times on the way to my office. However I was not very sure of the brand and initially thought that this maybe is a single outlet instead of a Pizza chain. Anyway, later I came to know that this is Australia's largest pizza chain. They also visited my office few days back but I missed the chance to try it out then.

Anyway, I ordered One 10" Gourmet Chicken Extravaganza with Extra Mozzarella Cheese and One Cheesy Garlic scroll. I ordered it through an online food order app(not Zomato) and even though the outlet is around 3 km from my house but still they delivered the pizza in around half an hour. So delivery is very good indeed.

Now coming to the quality and price of the food. The pizza was absolutely fresh and the crust was 100% juicy. I have ordered pizza from Dominoes an awful lot of times in my office or home but in most occasions I found the crust(especially the outer circumference) a bit hard. This one from Eagle Boys really impressed me. The toppings too felt fresher than Dominoes. So it really tastes very good. One point though, I was expecting a bit more cheese with the extra mozzarella cheese option but it was not like cheese burst type. I guess for that experience I need to choose other type of crusts. One 10" might not be sufficient for two adults for dining purpose so add a side dish with that if you may.

The cheese garlic was decent but I still love the Dominoes Garlic bread more. Also I didn't get any dips with that and didn't get any option to add any dip additionally while ordering. 

Now considering the quality of Eagle Boys Pizza and the price and quality of the competitors, I would say that the price here is definitely at par or better than others. Also I would surely recommend this outlet to other Pizza lovers. |
 
(229) Eagle Boys Pizza | Debasmita Bhowmick | None | 550934 | 4.5 | 2016-02-14 16:21:25 | Itz really the best pizza shop in kolkata and the pizza are really fresh.The pizzas are baked well.The ambience and the decorum is awsome.The sizes of pizzas are great. |
 
(230) Eagle Boys Pizza | Rohit Roy Chowdhury | None | 1257919 | 4.5 | 2016-02-11 22:07:03 | After seeing lots of positive reviews on Zomato we finally visited today at evening. Eagle Boys pizza is situated at EM BYPASS near VIP Bazaar, ambiance was good enough to notice, very clean place and seating arrangement were spacious and larger. Hospitality was very good. Ordered there chicken stack pizza with big cheese base. 
They use some kind of granular cheese which I found excellent in taste compare to other popular pizza brand in Kolkata. Crust was very thin and crunchy. Overall it was a great experience. Will definitely visit again within a week. |
 
(231) Eagle Boys Pizza | Moumita Pal | None | 33503358 | 5.0 | 2016-02-10 21:13:26 | I have been looking forward to trying this place since a long time. Finally went there last Sunday with my sis and the very first thing I wanna say about this place is I am going back this Saturday again. The Chicken Pena Pasta in White sauce is freaking tasty. The best pasta I ever had. The Pizza crust is so thin and when you order for extra cheese you really do get the sticky cheese that you dream of. And, in every bit you will get the toppings filled. I just wish you guys open up in the Malls and in better location. I can bet that Pizza Hut is even going to have a hard time and Dominos doesn;t even fall in competition. Top of it, if you are 1st time visitor, get a 20% off..You guys are amazing. A MUST FOR PIZZA LOVERS. THE BEST WHITE PASTA AND CHICKEN MEXICANA PIZZA WITHOUT A DOUBT. |
 
(232) Eagle Boys Pizza | Arijit De | None | 227718 | 4.0 | 2016-02-09 23:17:37 | Ordered today for the first time & loved it. The pizza crust was as soft as Pizza Hut pizzas & the cheese on it was enough. Ordered a simple cheesy chicken pizza medium 10" size. Oreganos & chilli flakes sachets were given in ample too. Price is cheaper than dominos but quality is equal. Will try again. |
 
(233) Eagle Boys Pizza | Sudeshna Sikder | None | 27781339 | 4.0 | 2016-02-07 16:23:21 | I have been wanting to try this outlet since long, and I could do it today. Ordered veg spicy pizza through online payment in zomato. And it lived upto its quality and name. Its exactly the thin crust as I love and it was delivered hot and fresh. Pizza was tasty and a medium size is enough for 1 foodie person like me. Im now ordering from here only. Happy im! |
 
(234) Eagle Boys Pizza | Reetwika Basu | None | 32409393 | 2.5 | 2016-02-06 12:26:01 | Though I'm a little late to put in my review however I thought better late than never. Me and one one my friends had ordered a takeaway from this place sometime back. Our orders consisted of Zesty Chicken Pizza and Chicken Stack Pizza. We had also orders a Brownie as a desert. However, Zesty Chicken Turned out to be quite satisfactory on the other hand, Chicken stack appeared to be surprisingly bad in taste. It tasted a weird combination of sourness and bitter. The brownie too was a little dissatisfying.
Given an option I would rather opt for Dominoes or Pizza Hut rather than Eagle Boys. |
 
(235) Eagle Boys Pizza | Somdatta Saha | None | 29010618 | 4.0 | 2016-02-05 00:24:54 | The pizzas here are fresh,cheesy and they taste AMAZING.
What makes it better are the offers on Wednesday and Thursday.¬†

Chicken mexicana,chicken extravaganza and spicy chicken are some of the best.
And go for the thin crust cheese burst pizzas,peepul. Absolute bliss. ^____^
Sweetza is suprisingly good. Perfect way to end your pizza meal with something sweet.
Prices are moderate,in fact good enough for what they offer. Service is decent.
The black-and-pink theme colour is attractive. The interior has that vibrant feel a pizza shop is supposed to have. |
 
(236) Eagle Boys Pizza | Shoily Nath | None | 33422387 | 3.0 | 2016-02-03 21:01:39 | the pizza was definitely better than domino's pizza-with more cheeze and overall tasted better. However, the paneer in my pizza tasted bitter and i had to pick it out. Cheeze scrolls tasted nice. The thin crust was good and crispy. Deep dish crust was soft. Would have given it a 4 if the paneer wasnt so bitter. |
 
(237) Eagle Boys Pizza | Chiraag Kumar | None | 32548639 | 4.5 | 2016-02-02 19:07:58 | It is beautiful and cozy place.
The food was delicious and of high quality and was complimented with very polite, humble, warm service. The pricing is very reasonable. And has got interesting offers. 

Would love to visit Again. And also hope to see many more outlets. |
 
(238) Eagle Boys Pizza | Gaurav Menezes | None | 1749359 | 4.0 | 2016-02-02 18:49:03 | Just visited today. Must say I was really wowed by the pizza when it came to the table.  When comparing this one with Dominos, Eagle Boys really stomped it. Overall, a good place to visit with friends! |
 
(239) Eagle Boys Pizza | Soumya Chakraborty | None | 30477306 | 4.5 | 2016-02-01 16:47:56 | Superb is the word! Never had such delicious pizzas before. Situated on the E.M. bypass makes it very easy to locate the joint. There is an introductory buy 1 get 1 offer going on which makes it even better. We had ordered a chicken mexicana pizza with thin and crispy crust and a chicken keema pizza with deep dish crust. Both were amazing in their own way. The ambience was good and so was the staff. Dominos and pizza hut are surely going to face some serious competition now. Hopeful about seeing more and more outlets all across the city. Would love to visit again and for people reading my review,do pay a visit. |
 
(240) Eagle Boys Pizza | Coolcandy Ankita | None | 33062685 | 3.5 | 2016-01-30 00:17:39 | LOVED it! Yes I would really start my review with that! Very cool ambience-with pink lights and pink seats- an uncommon set up. Extremely friendly staff and what they serve is absolutely fresh- that's exactly why they take a lot of time to serve post order but the food is worth the wait! They had a buy 1 get 1 free offer on every 10" and 13" pizza ordered - so We ordered two 10" pizzas - non veg spicy mexicanna (thin crust) and chicken keema pizza(deep crust). The first was v spicy and loaded with flavours while the later was what one calls- lip smacking!However the quantity of chicken in the pizzas could be increased! Nevertheless I think it's a must visit especially if you are a student because its quality food that's made pocket friendly and above all their pizzas are worth a try! |

(244) Eagle Boys Pizza | Avrojit Raha | None | 1279851 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 22:42:23 | This place has been open for quite sometime and inspite of being a stone's throw away from my house never ate from here before. So i decided to give it a try and the result was mindblowing. Their standard crust is THIN so that itself is a great start. Exceptional mozzarella cheese and hearty toppings. Their customization options are pretty cool as well and all being moderately priced. You can have a full meal for two at around rs. 450. This is one of the best pizzas i ever had. And way better than dominos, pizza hut fare. Will try their non veg items next time. Just a few suggestions...your seasoning is a tad too salty and you need to broaden your pasta, desserts range. Overall mark my house down guys, you will have to deliver here pretty regularly. |

It was good. Really good. But doesn't catch up with chili's.
Loved the crust. It was soft and cheesy yes I added cheese around the edges.
I regret for not ordering the large size. |
 
(246) Eagle Boys Pizza | Tanvy Selina | None | 16099951 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 21:36:05 | It might not be as well located as the other pizza joints in the city , but they definitely know how to make a pizza right on point. 
Ordered the thin crust Mexican Chicken pizza and it was amazing (with all that cheese and toppingsüòç) . Service and ambience is great too. Any day better than Pizza Hut and Dominos |
 
(247) Eagle Boys Pizza | Priyanka Jaiswal | None | 32368844 | 3.5 | 2016-01-26 14:39:19 | Had seen this place while crossing ruby and thought of having the pizza. They had a 20% discount going on. The pizza was really nice I must say. |

Falls on my way to college. Pizzas are far better than dominos, not sure about pizza hut though! It has potential to make me happy after a hectic college day. |

(251) Eagle Boys Pizza | Shamik Mukherjee | None | 2111058 | 4.5 | 2016-01-22 22:37:01 | Better than Domino's or Pizza Hut by a country mile. Period.
One of the best pizza experiences I've ever had. The garlic bread rolls are wonderful, and so too is the pasta. Barring the awkward location, this place has everything going in its favor. |

Byee Byee Pizzahut & Dominos. Welcome to Eagle Boys Pizza In Kolkata. Chicken Keema pizza is one of my favorite .. |
 
(255) Eagle Boys Pizza | L. | None | 2675340 | 4.0 | 2016-01-19 20:13:54 | I had ordered a chicken mexicana with extra cheese and one chicken n corn pizza(thin crust). Really nice! Eagle Boys Pizza is going to give a tough competition to Pizza Hut and Domios. Keep up the good work. |
 
(256) Eagle Boys Pizza | Sulagna Das | None | 245971 | 1.0 | 2016-01-19 14:16:21 | We ordered pizzas to be delivered and this was the condition in which it came!! All the toppings were pushed to one side while the order was being carried. Please put proper cheese instead of mayonnaise!!
And anyway, a die hard fan of Dominos Pizza is quite a challenge to be impressed by any new entry of the Indian market!
Nonetheless, all the very best of luck Eagle Boys Pizza. |
 
(257) Eagle Boys Pizza | Shannon Marcar | None | 32240803 | 1.0 | 2016-01-12 19:41:26 | Service incredibly poor with bad time management even though the place was empty. Very laid back and Slovenly attitude. Something that is so crucial is failed to be found at this place. |
 
(258) Eagle Boys Pizza | Mahasweta Paul | None | 364881 | 4.5 | 2016-01-10 22:21:56 | Safe to say one of the best decisions of my recent history. 

We had the Veg Lovers Pizza, since it was our first try there. The crust was deliciously soft and crunchy, a paradox that was sublime to our taste buds. The vegetables were fresh and juicy..they were still crunchy when they got served! 

We had gotten a 30% discount that day and for 318/- it was a delicious meal-snack for the three of us. Arent I right, |
 
(259) Eagle Boys Pizza | Avijit Biswas | None | 1095896 | 4.5 | 2016-01-10 10:39:32 | I really loved the freshness of there products... a big thanks... there quality and size are very good... deco was pretty attractive... and the staffs are very life full and friendly... taken the order with a smile delivered it with a smile... service time was little lengthy but the after effects are good... I opted for 1. Coffee... good, 2. Mexican pizza 7".... excellent and 3. Brownie bite... perfect, a scoop of vanilla will make it heavenly for sure, but it's not available... anyways, taken home there 1. Chessy blast medium spicy chicken pizza with mushroom and onion as extra veg toppings and tandoori chicken as non veg toppings... it's just heavenly, 2. Chicken popcorn... ok, 3. Chessy garlic scroll... very good, 4. Spicy garlic scroll... excellent, 5. Potato wedges... simple and finally 6. Sweetzza... awesome, excellent, extra ordinary... coming to the pocket pinch its ok as per there quality... Will surely order again... |
 
(260) Eagle Boys Pizza | Aniket Neogi | None | 1521514 | 4.5 | 2016-01-05 19:47:42 | Really great pizzas. Delivery is prompt and hassle free. Ordered Chicken Supreme. Taste and quality is amazing. 
Looking forward to the next order. üëçüèª |
 
(261) Eagle Boys Pizza | Rituraj Paul | None | 32425979 | 4.0 | 2016-01-05 11:05:56 | Do give this place a try.Totally worth it.Try out their Australian favourite non veg pizza.It is worth drooling over.
The location is a hassle though.Unless you have a vehicle of your own its difficult to commute to and fro from this place. |
 
(262) Eagle Boys Pizza | Pratap Singh | None | 33049356 | 5.0 | 2016-01-05 05:53:49 | Eagle Boys Pizza Kolkata ¬†Truly a place with spectacular fine dining! Even their food is absolutely enjoyable and worth every penny. The staff is courteous and joyous. I love their interiors. Has to offer one of the best pizzas in town. Domino's doesn't stand a chance in front of it. Down to their cutlery, I sincerely adored my time here. It is not too pricey as well for its quality and quantity. 

This outlet also has ample space to occupy several persons. |
 
(263) Eagle Boys Pizza | Samir Shah | None | 1338568 | 3.5 | 2016-01-04 18:58:21 | I read a lot of reviews about this place and being a pizza freak I had to go there. For the people who do not know, it a a famous pizza franchisee from Australia. Came here on a Sunday with my wife. The place is not that far but the visibly from the main road is not proper. Once we reached, the place looked nice and clean. There is plenty parking space also. We ordered 3 pizzas margarita, Mexican delight and Australia's special. We ordered all in thin crust and all of them were really tasty. They were fresh and hot and met my expectations. The best was the Australia's special which had pineapple and corn, just loved it. The best part about the place is the staff is super friendly and courteous. I feel in todays maker they are better than pizza hut and dominos as I liked their pizza sauce better than others. I am waiting for them to open more stores in the city centre so that I can enjoy their pizzas more frequently. |
 
(264) Eagle Boys Pizza | Mrittikachatterjee95 | None | 802380 | 4.5 | 2016-01-03 23:17:08 | We just suddenly decided to go here today and I'm glad we did because the pizza was incredible. We had the aussie's favourite chicken pizza, chicken wings and the cheesy garlic scroll. The chicken wings were spicy, tangy and tasted similar to tandoori chicken which was nice in a way. The garlic scroll was also amazing (I'm a sucker for garlic bread so no wonder the garlic scroll was a hit). The pizza crust was really good and I love pineapple on pizza so the combination of toppings was also amazing! Although I wish they had added pepperoni pizza to their menu because that would have been epic!
The staff is super friendly and we had a great time! |
 
(265) Eagle Boys Pizza | Souvik Bhattacharya | None | 1352528 | 4.5 | 2016-01-01 16:37:39 | The first meal of the new year I chose Eagle Boys Pizza near Ruby Hospital. The newest kid in pizza world of the city doesn't have decor or location to show off but the pizzas they are serving will soon give Domino's and Pizza Hut a run for their money.

We had Chicken Mexicana, Aussie's Favourite Chicken and Triple Chocolate Sweetzaa. Chicken Mexicana is not as spicy like will give up hiccups topped with Jalape√±o, Onion, Capsicum and Green Chilli with succulent chicken cubes. This should be enjoyed with cheesy blast base. Aussie's Favourite Chicken topped with pineapple chunks, sweet corn, onion, capsicum and fresh garlic. Again this is recommended with big cheese base. Though these ingredients are same as one will find in Domino's and Pizza Hut but Eagle Boys not only use what mentioned in menu but the freshest ingredients too. Hence the pizzas are juicy, soft, delicate and full of taste.
The most innovative pizza I found was Triple Chocolate Sweetzza. The base of the dessert is 7 inches thin crust base topped with rich layer of chocolate sauce with drizzle of dark chocolate and white chocolate chips. The dessert taste heavenly once served piping hot out out of oven.

We got 25% off on total bill and paid INR 1074 inclusive all. On the new year took my myself an oath if ever I try pizza then will be Eagle Boys. Will wish Anthony and his team all the best and keep flying high like eagle. No parking issue faced. Small suggestion keep plastic disposable glass near water dispenser and paper towel or had drier near wash basin. |
 
(266) Eagle Boys Pizza | Siddhanth Roy Barman | None | 29775149 | 4.0 | 2015-12-31 15:53:40 | Except for the location and parking issues, everything about Eagle Boys Pizza is AWESOME! Their pizzas are delicious, their staff is very friendly and the environment is great! |
 
(267) Eagle Boys Pizza | Debaleena | None | 204142 | 3.5 | 2015-12-31 01:51:30 | If Dominoe's pizza is the standard on which you measure other pizzas with, Eagles is higher placed than both Dominoe's and Pizza Hut (which I greatly dislike). Both the Veg extravaganza and spicy chicken pizzas (wednesday loot for buy one get one free), measured up well with soft pizza base and adequate toppings. 

Now the catch is that Eagles scores high only in comparison to Dominoe's, our desi pizza wonder company. If one puts it in the same rank as an international chain of acclaimed pizza offering, it doesn't match up.

 It is another moot point all together whether such international food offering is business-wise viable for Calcutta. For the time being, Eagles is on the same path as Dominoe's - ordering an Indian menu, tapping into local taste buds, and offering competitive prices (and even sending tomato sauce to have with pizza). I see no reason for it to fail, since it has got the trick to crack Indian food market right. |
 
(268) Eagle Boys Pizza | Anirban Dutta | None | 16184326 | 5.0 | 2015-12-31 00:36:27 | I found heaven, best pizzas ever. Starting from the bread, the cheese, the toppings, everything tasted just perfect. I couldn't click any photos because I was too busy with my pizza, sorry! |
 
(269) Eagle Boys Pizza | Ayan Das | None | 191266 | 4.5 | 2015-12-30 17:45:36 | Just one word awesome. If you like pizza you have to try eagel boys pizza its much better than dominos and pizza hut(this is my opinion).
On wednesday the have bogo offer. I ordered a 13 inch chicken supreme and it tasted really good. One more tip when you buy a pizza add extra cheese it tastes heavenly. The staff are very friendly and abience is also very good. Would have rated 5 but one major drawback is the location( Opp to jalshagarh) very difficult to park your car. |
 
(270) Eagle Boys Pizza | Pratyusha Maity | None | 30138643 | 4.5 | 2015-12-30 13:25:24 | I loved the pizza. I had ordered a medium zesty chicken pizza. Since its a wednesday i got another zesty chicken pizza free. The pizza was done to perfection. This was my first time and trust me , I am going to have pizzas from none other than Eagle Boys. Its time to ditch Dominos & Pizza Hut. Quality of cheese is truly good. I ordered for a home delivery and it arrived at the exact time I was mentioned of. Extremely pleased with their service and quality. Gonna visit the outlet soon. |
 
(271) Eagle Boys Pizza | Saurangsu Lahiri | None | 113713 | 4.0 | 2015-12-26 13:58:14 | There are those weekends when your so lazy, that you don't feel like going anywhere, and wish there was a good food joint nearby. Well EBP is that food joint for me. It's less than 5 mins walk away, and I have been here a couple times. I'll say this place serves good pizza, although all varieties that they advertise are not available. Here's the catch - They serve pizzas hot and fresh when you are having them in their outlet. However, their home delivery service is not good. 
I'll suggest pizza fanatics to visit this place. They have a unique taste which is different from Dominos or PH, and slightly cheaper too. |
 
(272) Eagle Boys Pizza | Prajna Gupta | None | 3110493 | 4.5 | 2015-12-26 11:01:25 | A really novel experience..for all these days pizza meant Dominos and Pizza Hut. Pizza hut is really good but owing to the great distance from my home..we usually ordered from Dominos(which isnt really worth the price..:3)
Now after trying here..i felt satisfied . Loved the taste of the pizza..the crust was soft and just right. Had ordered a spicy chicken(deep dish) . The combo of chicken and cheese and corns and jalapenos graced my tongue beautifully...and then i had ordered a Triple chocolate sweetza and a brownie bite. The sweetza is a delicacy here with loads of choc syrup, white and dark choc chips on a pizza bread..its served hot and is a delish. The brownie was a fudgy one and was really good. 
Overall i really loved it..the price was also good and so was the meal. |

Better than Dominos and pizza Hut. 
Swetzza is a unique chocolaty pizza, which is great. Great environment great place to hang out |
 
(275) Eagle Boys Pizza | Mark H | None | 20326534 | 5.0 | 2015-12-23 18:43:58 | YUM! After trying Domino's and Pizza Hut here I'd choose EB any day. Best pizzas I've had in a long time (closer to North American style yeah!!). Great prices, offers (BOGO.. Thank you) and flavours. People on the phone were extremely polite and even the guy who delivered was very cordial.  I ordered a Chicken Stack and Spicy Chicken, i asked for the corn to be taken out (as a preference) and was offered a substitution, so i chose mushrooms, that actually didn't happen when the pizzas arrived but no harm. Extremely satisfied, Great job guys look forward to more pizzas from you and I'm gonna tell all my friends too. Only things I would change is the quality of the paper napkins. |
 
(276) Eagle Boys Pizza | Rukshana Kapadia | None | 168480 | 3.5 | 2015-12-23 17:42:17 | Eagle Boys Pizza is the new kid on the block and we tried it out a few days back. Good service and good Pizza at par with Dominos and Pizza Hut.¬†
We had ordered a medium Chicken Extravaganza and it was quite good. They had a buy one get one free offer on so we tried the Cheesy Chicken Pizza which was nice though I liked the other one better. I would certainly order the Extravaganza again.
Strangely though they are an international chain they don't have a Pepperoni Pizza.¬†
Overall a pleasant experience. |
 
(277) Eagle Boys Pizza | Souparno Roy | None | 2765492 | 5.0 | 2015-12-22 20:00:46 | Firstly, good bye dominoes and pizza hut... Will miss u..! :p probably the best pizza joint in town... Try any pizza u will love it... Even the popcorns brownies all are just super good.( too high on food to find any proper adjective)
Secondly the people serving the food were very helpful, interactive.. The gave us a complementary brownie as they took time to prepare the sweetzie... Dunno any other place where they do so...
Thirdly the reasonable price...! 
All these sums up eagle boys... Way to go guys..!! 
Oh, and I forgot the offers.. go on Monday, Wednesday or Thursday....!! |
 
(278) Eagle Boys Pizza | Sourav Chatterjee | None | 32855837 | 5.0 | 2015-12-22 19:10:27 | The food is awesome here. The best pizza I've had till date. The Big Cheese add-on is too good.

(279) Eagle Boys Pizza | Bitasta | None | 3139063 | 5.0 | 2015-12-22 18:29:51 | THE best pizzas in town..and the people are lovely!!..and very very affordable!!..bye bye dominoes and pizza hut!!..
we had pasta in white sauce which was YUM! ( recommended)..we had about 5 different pizzas and everyone of them are recommendable!!.. Go for addons big cheese or cheesy blast!!..they are sooooo worth it..we had sweetzza which is the only thing that'll get 4/5 because it was too sweet for my taste..and the best part was ..because sweetzaa was taking a bit of time for preparation they gave us complementary brownies (!!!)..who does that right?!..told you they are some lovely people!!..anyway brownie was delicious as well!!..they have a variety of offers like 30% off on Mondays.. We got 20%..undoubtedly the best pizza joint in Kolkata!!..looking fwd to go back there soon!! |
 
(280) Eagle Boys Pizza | Dani | None | 27456850 | 5.0 | 2015-12-15 09:10:58 | Delicious affordable pizzas....30% flat off on Mondays :-) :-) :-)
Loved the scrolls!!
Outstanding service and superb recovery.  Thank you for the warm gesture. Eagle Boys have found themselves a loyal fan... |
 
(281) Eagle Boys Pizza | Tanya Sarkar | None | 127238 | 3.0 | 2015-12-14 22:51:03 | I had an eye for this joint ever since i saw the place being constructed and couldnt wait to give it a try. Finally today i ordered online via zomato. Firstly i must say this online process is smooth as cake and very convenient. Hats off zomato!! 

Now coming to eagle boys... Well i think they need lil polishing when it comes to their pizza or garlic bread. I ordered for the chicken mexicana and cheese garlic bread. It fails to stand at par with its other branches. The spicy mix topping is a good addition as it added extra taste but I would any day prefer pizza hut. The pizza was very average and the garlic bread lacked taste. The cheeze does not tantalize ones taste buds for sure. To woo the customers , Guys please come up with some innovations. An average tasting pizza is not what we seek anymore.

The delivery was really quick i have to admit. I read a review that they had poor service and i think they took note of that and made amends which is commendable.

Prices are affordable but the quantity of their wedges is very poor. |

(283) Eagle Boys Pizza | Chandrajit Rudra | None | 137719 | 4.5 | 2015-12-06 18:11:57 | A RARE EXPERIENCE -
There are very few places who take their feedback seriously and this place is among them. They took their feedback extremely seriously. Customer Feedback and Satisfaction!!! Every restaurant would be a foodies heaven, if they learn even 1% from this place.

My 2nd order was just a large Veg Extravaganza and they delivered me 2 Large Veg Extravaganza and a Triple Sweetzza for FREE, as a good gesture. Why? Read on...

First Experience - Worst Dessert quality.
They charged 99 for the Triple Choclate dessert and it was not even worth 10. Full of raw sugar and a total crap in the name of chocolates.

Pizzas are ok.

Garlic Breads were not good. Too tight and the edges were just bread.

[6/12/15] Updated Rating from 1.5 to 2.5: They have a good feedback system. Their store manager Anthony calls up customers individually for feedback. Had a conversation with him and he was courteous enough to listen to the feedback and promised on improvement. Will try again and post back.

[6/12/15 Evening] Updated Rating from 2.5 to 4.5
I ordered a Large Veg Extravaganza after a word with their Manager Anthony who had called for feedback. As an wonderful gesture, they provided one more Large Veg Extravaganza free (though it was not a Wednesday as they provide another for free). On top of that, an extra Triple Chocolate Sweetzza was provided for free as a good gesture.
I should have been billed more than 1500 but they insisted on taking only 700 bucks.

The pizzas were definitely good but the Triple Chocolate Sweetzza was still too sweet. Maybe my taste buds will not favor that type ever.

However, they deserve a 4.5/5 because of this rare gesture that I doubt any other place could ever offer. Being so much attentive to Customer Satisfaction, and acting so quick! There is no doubt this place will rocket to be a top Pizza spot in the city.

[24/01/16] A suggestion: Try their thin and crusty Pizza Base. Its way better than the rest. |

Kudos to the entire team of eagle boys.

Moreover the service provided with by the employees out there is really appreciative, they know how to handle their customers and provide accurate customer service.

Special thanks to Dipika for providing us such a friendly and kool environment. ¬†

Once again special thanks to DIPIKA. |

(292) Eagle Boys Pizza | Bitan Datta | None | 224851 | 3.5 | 2015-11-08 11:29:44 | In the quest to find an alternate to domino's and pizza hut,over the years I have tried quite a few places in the city.With eagle boys pizza,the effort paid off in spades.The propensity to eat handsome food at first sight is an impulse that's older than dirt itself.Over the years,evolution has made made us very particular of what we eat and how much we eat.However,with heart warming food,this evolutionary process seems to¬† be a fallacy in itself.Overeating lead to obesity which is quite frankly,at large these days.I have seen dudes(and dudettes) who are larger than some nations.This merry banter aside,and not making a foray into eagle boys' future prospects in contributing to the nation's overweight problem,I will return to the job at hand.

On a saturday afternoon I found them enlisted in zomato order app,and ordered a 10 inch chicken keema pizza with added pineapple toppings,chicken nuggets and triple chocolate sweetza for a sweet closure.

What's good-Chicken kimma pizza comes under super non veg section,which is equivalent to domino's non veg special,but is cheaper.They also normally use thin crust or deep dish,and it feels like a charity case,because domino's charges extra bucks for these.The domino's horror show,the very infamous and oral mucosa hostile classic hand tossed base is conspicuously and fortunately absent here.The pizza tasted just as good.Moving on,triple chocolate sweetza is one charming dessert,and is closely related to the donut family.However,instead of the customary hoola loop like bread,they use a 7 inch pizza dough and drizzle chocolate and crunchies all over it.This is the one to lookout for.

what's bad-I have tried only one side,the chicken nuggets.They give 6pcs at a reasonable 89/-.But here's the rub.On a good day,a venky's nugget will taste¬† better,even if I am the one frying those babies.The nuggets are small,stymied,and of not particularly healthy deposition.While I may have used semantics to¬† express the same sentiment thrice,it's suffice to say that it's a work in progress.Also,they don't have a 30 minute guarantee,and I received my order almost an hour later.

tidbits-They charge 20% tax(VAT and serivce tax).Best time to order is wednesday(buy one get one free)>monday(30%off)>thursday(10 inch or 13 inch pizza fetches you 50% discount on the second pizza) |

I guess Dominos (the worst pizza makers in India) serves better pizzas than them. I mean for example if you order a pizza with onion as one of the topping, you will hv to search with a magnifying glass to find one small piece of onion. Disappointed with it. Never gonna order again. |
 
(295) Eagle Boys Pizza | Heathcliff Wieder | None | 777172 | 4.0 | 2015-11-03 23:03:36 | This joint is a refreshing change, offering a middle path between the fast-food and sandwich-shop pizzas and the signature, pricey Dominos and Pizza Hut (I am not including the fine-dining options such as the "kitchens of spaghetti" and "Ice, Fire, and other elements of nature" in my review ;) . Or they are this way at least till they spread their network and consider bumping up prices.

The menu is more or less the regular fare - Supreme, Extravaganza,.. names that we have grown up hearing. The Cheesy Garlic roll is a delightful change from the Dominos version - soft and cheesy on the outside, but a nice crisp outer crust. The pizzas come with liberal amounts of cheese in the garnishing, and fresh and sufficient veggies (BTW, we ordered all veg on our visit). Their bases are more like Pizza Hut's, and their pan pizza base is doused in butter - just the way we like it, allowing us to eat it all the way up to the edge and not stop an inch before! On a Saturday, we got a 'Buy 1 Get 1 Free" on our order ¬†of 1 medium, giving us a meal for 4 for around 700 bucks. Not a bad deal at all! This included 2 drinks and the garlic bread, of course.

Their staff is friendly and ready to serve. The service was prompt (and yes, they bake their pizza bases fresh).

Now for the cons. As this is a new place they are obviously going through some teething. We ordered our eat-in medium on a thin crust and the take-away on a pan. However the order was recorded as pan for both. These are also the only base options available. We were informed that the stuffed base options would be available as soon as the equipment to bake them arrives. The establishment also needs to do something about the pests - too many insects and a few mosquitos too. We understand that this is that time of the year, but they should probably consider increasing the count of their flycatcher lights. Maybe also pump up the air-con to address this problem..

All in all, a thumbs-up to the place! Ideal for eating in if you are a small party (and enjoy brightly coloured interiors). Need to experience their delivery service as of yet. Finally Kolkata has got its alternatives to the big fish! Bangalore, Delhi, Bombay had them, we've got them too now! |

(301) Eagle Boys Pizza | Pratiti Nath | None | 31427037 | 4.5 | 2015-10-28 18:43:16 | Good food, nice ambience, good decor, apt choice of colors, well suited view from the pizzeria makes it an excellent place. The pizza had quite good soft and crunchy crust. I had an regular chicken stack pizza. The pizza requires a few bits of chicken otherwise it's good to go. The only thing it lacks is a good collection of music but they made it up with the hand-written thank you note from the waitress. I liked it very much and I shall be preserving it. I hope you don't mind if I post a picture of it. Looking forward to visit again. |
 
(302) Eagle Boys Pizza | Reshma Parveen | None | 31103652 | 3.5 | 2015-10-27 09:00:47 | Just yesterday, had my 1st pizza from EB. I ordered chicken mexicana, aussie's favourite chicken n chicken penne. I liked aussie's fav chickn the most. It was a lil bit spicy as well as sweet bcoz of small chunks of pineapple. Chicken mexicana was quite spicy for me n the taste wasnt that much unique. the crust was thin n crispy. Chicken penne was ok type. 1ce earlier had ordered chicken popcorn n tht was below avg. Dont xpect the xact taste that u get at KFC. Offers r good.. overall what i can is that u can give it a try but dont xpect much from the side dishes. Either they r avg or below avg.. |
 
(303) Eagle Boys Pizza | Sohini Bhattacharyya | None | 31773625 | 3.5 | 2015-10-26 12:23:39 | Well. The ambience could be better. The pizza was OK. But the offers were nice. Pizza crust is soft. But could be more cheesy. Spices are alright. So overall an OK place to@ visit. |
 
(304) Eagle Boys Pizza | Jayashri Chattaraj | None | 32295460 | 5.0 | 2015-10-25 23:49:37 | Locating the store is a problem. If you are going towards science city from ruby hospital crossing the store is on your left, can be seen from the bypass. But you have to take the kachcha service road much before, from Tagore Park, in front of Hotel Sheldon, to reach the restaurant. However, once you reach, everything is just fine! The decor, the ambience, the service, and above all, the pizzas!! Undoubtedly, the pizzas are better than what Dominos and even Pizza Hut offers. Delicious is the word! A must visit place for all pizza lovers! |
 
(305) Eagle Boys Pizza | Zarita Guha Sarkar | None | 32293783 | 5.0 | 2015-10-25 20:45:35 | Had the greatest pizza of my life at Eagle Boys Pizza Kolkata yesterday! Not only the pizzas were delicious, the base is so soft and tasty that one can eat it without the toppings! The Triple Chocolate Sweetzza, a dessert pizza, deserves special mention. Forget Pizza Hut and Dominos! Go and try Eagle Boys Pizza. |

Well, last time I ordered from this place I had a very bad experience and I swore never to order from this place again. Yesterday I got a call from the manager of this place and he offered me a free complimentary meal of the same pizza I ordered last time and a chance to rectify their mistakes. I agreed and the Pizza was delivered.Unlike last time, this time the pizza was brought in a proper pizza bag which keeps it hot instead of a Polly Bag. And hot it was. The chilli flakes they provided along with the other seasonings just burned me. So if you are applying ¬†the flakes on your pizza be aware you don't add a lot.The crust was just what it should be. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The cheese you can really taste and the smell that came out along with the hot steam made this foodie hard to wait without having a bite. The Triple Chocolate Sweetzza I got this time had chocolate chips, both brown and white and it tasted as good as beautiful it looked.
There's hell and heaven difference between what I got last time and what was delivered to me this time. If this is what they deliver every time then this is surely going to climb up my fav pizza joint list much faster than any other. Now I can really recommend this place to everyone and I will be ordering from this place very soon.¬†Special mentions here are their zeal to act on their mistakes and make them better and in literal terms doing what it takes to satisfy their customers.

Its festive mood in Kolkata. That mood was totally destroyed when I decided to order from the newly opened Eagle Boys today.

Firstly the person taking the order on the phone doesn't know how to talk. You can‚Äôt understand half of what he says and every time you have to ask again. I ordered one 10" Chicken Stack, one 7" Chicken Stack, one Triple Chocolate Sweetzza and a coke. When the order finally arrived it was cold and dry. And I was really surprised to see they gave no seasoning in the package and also none on top of the pizza either. How am I supposed to eat a cold dry pizza without any seasoning? Am I supposed to swallow them directly with the coke?

I am glad there are other better pizza places in town so that I never ever have to order from this place ever again. Worst experience ever. |
