Saldanha Bakery | 18224075 | (22.5557437485, 88.3580046147) | https://www.zomato.com/kolkata/saldanha-bakery-wellesley | ['Bakery', 'Desserts']

Saldanha Bakery | Shaurya Pathak | 367302 | 4.0 | 2016-12-17 21:09:23 | It will be a time taking process to find this place. But it will test your resolve for the love of food.
Don't look around. Just look down and enjoy the lip smacking goodies. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Kashif Ahmed | 1115831 | 4.5 | 2016-12-14 19:10:28 | Surprisingly, this joint serves the best Walnut Cakes i have ever tasted in my life..... It is a very old bakery.... The patties is also lip smacking....
Strongly recommend the Walnut Cake, try it once....But kindly refrain from taking your vehicle as parking is a serious pain..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Amrita Mondal | 36255179 | 4.0 | 2016-10-28 21:36:46 | The best bakery in town for traditional Christmas goodies like fruit cake, walnut cake, plain butter cake, plum cake, Brownies, tarts, etc. It is a place where bulk orders are taken generally. It is not a shop or a cafe. It is a bakery where you order stuff and take away. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tuks4 | 36484659 | 4.5 | 2016-10-25 00:29:07 | ive been an indirect customer of this bakery for a while.. my sis's school orders their items regularly and i get to taste them too :)
this time though, i went to the place & had my own order.. a good number of chicken & corn envelope & choc truffle cake, both eggless & w/ egg..

my 1 line verdict.. the BEST bakery in the city.. period. in terms of taste + price + raw materials + the care + the old-school process, this is without doubt the best place in Calcutta.. & i repeat CALCUTTA and not kolkatta or kolkutta or some other rubbish misnaming this city gets !
this is the place that makes proper patties, proper macrones, cakes & pastries.. almost all of their items taste uniquely clean & refined.. and someone with a decent palette, will feel the 'non-commercial' taste as well..

i had a client team visiting from Poland who were extremely happy eating these items..¬† chicken envelope is their costliest item @35 a pc.. v filling yet flaky & light.. the choc truffle cake melted away inside the mouth.. super soft !
ul see amul butter being used to fry the onions.. pure almond crumbs being used inside the cake's base.. egg whites been beaten for 30mins until those nice soft peaks show up.. no wonder the taste is superlative !

few downsides to mention.. the cheese puff is not good at all.. slice cakes are sometimes stiff.. the place can do better without being that cluttery.. someone with a nose for hygiene might not be thrilled with all the 'hands' being used.. but i guess that too is their USP at some point :) |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anushka Agarwal | 34748091 | 3.5 | 2016-10-24 11:21:12 | Been to this joint lately and loved their brownies and cakes. They are freshly baked and delicious both at the same time. Usually if you go to this place during late evening you'll miss out on most of the stuffs. Pre-ordering recommended. ‚úåüèªÔ∏è |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Debadyuti Karan | 5018051 | 4.0 | 2016-08-30 22:52:05 | Kolkata is full of sweet surprises. Who would ever guess that an old yellow house in central Kolkata houses one of the best bakeries in town?! A cake lovers paradise, this bakery is famous for its weddings cakes for the Anglo Indians. Good things don't come easy; one needs to make an effort to relish their creations. A pre order is a must at this 80 year old bakery. While most of their stuff is good, the must must must on the order list would be their almond cake, coconut macaroons and their soft moist dark brownies. If you are lucky and drop by you might find some' bakes' of the day that you could pick up. Debra Saldanha one of the daughters now runs the place and maintains the high quality standard set by her parents. The place is not a fancy store. They know their quality is far better than most bakeries in town and they let their baking do the talking. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Rajtilak Bhattacharjee | 68484 | 5.0 | 2016-08-20 22:28:12 | The best bakery in Kolkata. Must try their almond cakes, macaroons, and chocolate fudges. You can pre-order, although there is no home delivery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Indrajit Lahiri | 542545 | 4.5 | 2016-08-02 16:47:16 | There goes around a story in Kolkata gastronomic circuit that the best traditional l anglo-Indian cakes are found not in fancy hotels, but in few homes, and over the period of time, they‚Äôve become legends. Many have heard of the name, but few have actually been there, the name‚Äôs Saldanha Bakery and Confectionary

One should reach Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road (the tram road) and find out the B C Sen Jewellery shop on it. While in the afternoon, the traffic moves towards north, it comes on the right hand side. Take the adjacent lane and after 50-100 mtrs, you can find a yellow house on your left with Saldanha written on the outside wall. Parking is a big big problem. Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tisyaketu Sirkar | 3479861 | 5.0 | 2016-07-14 13:57:20 | This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Sumit Surai | 11641 | 4.0 | 2016-07-13 22:52:39 | This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Arjun Kumar Roy | 33434945 | 5.0 | 2016-05-18 00:48:34 | Its an amazing bakery where we get great some authentic baked products. Please try their cakes, mousses and other stuff... Its one the oldest in our city and serves you upto your expectations... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anwesha Ghosh | 14295941 | 3.5 | 2016-02-12 19:26:47 | One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Jude Martin | 1895578 | 4.0 | 2016-01-26 23:48:16 | Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Suhail Hassan | 684685 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 15:28:43 | Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items**** |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Koushik Paul | 16411585 | 4.5 | 2016-01-09 10:10:47 | What to say about this!! It is actually a hidden gem! One of my friend suggested this for Christmas cake shopping. It made us tired to find it out but cakes are actually superb!!! |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Oindrila Paul | 16152668 | 5.0 | 2016-01-08 00:38:34 | I will give 5 stars to this bakery because I've eaten here many a times and if has never let me down. Right from it's vegetarian items to the non vegetarian ones, and from the pastries to the cakes, Saldanha is pure bliss |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Madhurya Chaudhuri | 30816267 | 4.5 | 2016-01-06 21:09:10 | Awesome cakes,brownies,lemon drops and chicken patties . British cakes are the best. Assorted chocolates are good too. And everything comes in a very reasonable price. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Swarnendu Chandra | 32142557 | 5.0 | 2016-01-02 14:06:38 | I visited this place after reading a report in a local newspaper, and experience was mesmerizing. The walnut cake and fruit cake was simply delicious. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Souvik Sen | 9493051 | 4.5 | 2015-12-29 16:56:20 | Great Cakes I must say...This year I had their walnut & chocolate cakes in Christmas...Both was fabulous...Walnut was better...Price was INR 220/- per cake but considering the quality it really worth it..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Apple Orange | 31197595 | 5.0 | 2015-12-25 17:26:35 | I have never been to the shop but in our office every year during Christmas we get cakes from Saldanah Bakery and it is never enough...The Christmas cakes are simply what a first class cake should be...soft ...fresh and...the level sweetness is just right..love it every year and now it's  a ritual...will be visiting soon..üòäüòäüòä |

Monkey Bar | 18361667 | (22.544307, 88.352079) | https://www.zomato.com/kolkata/monkey-bar-camac-street-area | ['American', 'Asian', 'European', 'North Indian']

Monkey Bar | Sirsha Dhar | 2015246 | 4.5 | 2016-12-15 21:54:11 | My friend, who was leaving the city soon wanted to go out for food and drinks and what could have been better than our decision to hit the Monkey Bar. Finally opened in Kolkata, one of the best-located bar there possibly is. On the 9th floor of Fort Knox on Camac Street, this looks down the beautiful Kolkata skyline with the 2nd bridge, Victoria, St. Pauls church and what not. The place is huge, quaintly decorated with the essential Bong touch both in the menu and the bar. Has an open area with a huge screen. 
For food we ordered the Mobar Caramelised Pork Ribs. Melt in the mouth pork meat. Smoked Chicken, Chicken Salami and Harissa pizza. For drinks we took the Beamer LIIT. Just the right punch of alcohol and tang! Lovely experience. Would definitely like to go back again. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohan Belani | 3081061 | 3.5 | 2016-12-15 02:58:39 | The place has a chill vibe . Went with a few school buddies.  There is a open air section as well as an indoor section where you can sit and chill . Drinks were nice . Service could be better . The staff were not attentive enough . Lastly the music . There were people singing karaoke. I mean it's cool to sing and all but we expected some chill music with the setting . |
 
Monkey Bar | Pratik Shah | 31614924 | 3.0 | 2016-12-14 13:50:20 | With an indoor and outdoor seating options and great ambience "monkey bar" is sure to impress you . I didnt order much to eat , bt watever i ordered was average - 
Yes it is lil on the expensive side - overall good place to chill once in a while . |
 
Monkey Bar | Shruti Bhaiya | 593379 | 4.0 | 2016-12-11 17:47:13 | A must go places for the party peeps in kolkata.  Good food , good music and an awesome ambience. .  A complete thumbs up .. the only thumbs down would be the quantity  of the food served , it's too little and gives u just a taste of the dish !! |
 
Monkey Bar | Avinaba Das Sarkar | 409341 | 3.0 | 2016-12-11 11:02:59 | Went yesterday with a business partner, wasn't really very particular about a place but since it was located near by thought of visiting it once. Few observations

1. The ambiance is nice and the interiors are pretty well done.

2. Music is pretty loud and if you are intending to have a prolonged conversation with someone it would be difficult. 

3. The biggest drawback is the food, we ordered two veg starters since my friend was veg. The quantity and the taste wasn't something justifying the price or the brand. The food was OK but it isn't something one will find difficult to prepare in there kitchen. 

Overall experience was okay since we primarily went there to seat and talk. But comparing the same with the likes to cafe mezzuna or the grid would make this place average at the best. Hope the management looks into it. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rishi Agarwal | 1632482 | 4.5 | 2016-12-10 17:02:43 | On the 9th floor at Fort Knox, the newly opened Monkey Bar is a beautiful place to visit. The place offers an unmatched view of the city and the interiors and a class apart which make it one step ahead of other places in the city.
The food on offer is delicious. The mushrooms I ordered and the chilli cheese dragons are a must try for all.
Overall a great new place to visit with a great atmosphere and very polite attendants. |
 
Monkey Bar | TraveKings | 29893242 | 4.5 | 2016-12-07 13:14:55 | Located at Fort Knox. It is like Social in Delhi. Good Ambience. Maintaining a Good Standard. Decent Crowd. Decent Hookah & Decent Food. Good Service.¬†2 big screen to enjoy live sports .¬†Little expensive. It will cost around Rs.3000 for 2 person.A Good place to hangout with friends. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sukanya Ghosh | 589490 | 3.5 | 2016-12-04 21:24:11 | This one is new in Kolkata, and is definitely pulling lot of crowd. I went there on a Friday evening with two of my friends and it was full of people. Located in camac street, near Urban Desi, not too difficult to locate. The moment you step in , the first thing you notice are the big french windows with a view to die for :), Howrah Bridge and Victoria Memorial at the same, who would not love that!¬†
Now coming to the food, its nothing extraordinary, very mediocre tasting with prices on the higher side. We ordered for 1 mix mushroom bruschetta, mushroom and truffle oil pizza, and tikki of joy (fish). The bruschetta and the pizza was very ordinary, bland in taste I would say. Tikki of joy was definitely good with very subtle flavours, perfectly cooked to perfection.
My rating is truly for the ambience and the fish, anyway one could always try out this place¬†
Thumbs up for the view :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Gunjan Saraf | 33964908 | 4.5 | 2016-12-03 14:49:16 | My visit to this place raised my bar of expectations from kolkatas nightlife.. Posh crowd, sophisticated ambience, soothing music, projector screen for matches, good food and superb hukka! The place has it all. We ordered for lebanese platter and cheese spring rolls, both finger licking good! The capuccino cofee was average but the hukka made up for it! A must visit for all the crazy kolkatans looking for a break from chai break! |
 
Monkey Bar | Subham Agarwal | 777244 | 1.0 | 2016-12-01 13:05:10 | THIS PLACE IS PATHETIC

I ATE THE PANEER KHICHDI AND I AND MY FRIEND BOTH ¬†HAD A TERRIBLE INFECTION AFTER HAVING THIS. I THINK THEIR COOKING STANDARDS ARE VERY LOW.

WHEN I CALLED THEM TO SAY THAT I HAD A TERRIBLE INFECTION AFTER HAVING YOUR FOOD THEY ¬†HAD NO ANSWER.

I HAVE ALSO PUT UP A COMPLAIN AT FOOD AND QUALITY STANDARDS DEPARTMENT AGAINST THEM,

I SUGGEST NO ONE SHOULD GO THERE AT ALL. |
 
Monkey Bar | Risshe Malhotra | 31063007 | 4.5 | 2016-11-29 22:39:12 | Amazing food lovely ambience, joy is one of the best ppl he makes you feel special and the service is out of the world. Centrally located... |
 
Monkey Bar | Reetuparna Dutta | 1190721 | 4.5 | 2016-11-28 17:24:05 | Great place good food and good atmosphere. Loved the drinks as well ordered the manga with absolut and hot wings and loaded nachos with chicken . Everything was top notch. |
 
Monkey Bar | Kirti Agarwal | 16014301 | 3.0 | 2016-11-28 15:30:12 | I think it is one of the over rated places..the service was ok..music was very sad n sheesha not dat great...although ambience was good..but such a brand it is..der is an expectation bar which it disappoints to a great extent. |
 
Monkey Bar | Amrita Ghosh | 33949647 | 4.0 | 2016-11-26 20:51:37 | Want to dine with a view of Victoria memorial, step in here, which interiors n amazing food, gud classics as music and a lovely crowd, one cn spend hours here dining n wining. Food: chicken nachos is a good quantity. Mediterranean platter a lovly combo of flavors n great taste. Pizzas are thin crust n perfect. Drinks are innovative, I tried mamas girl & mojitos. Its one a litl higher side on the pocket but not exorbitant. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sanjiv Sood | 186102 | 4.5 | 2016-11-26 07:39:01 | The ‚ÄòMonkey Bar‚Äô Kolkata Avatar is a welcome addition to it's watering hole map and what an experience it metes out! Located in the heart of the city (Camac Street) with a huge and lofty space, it exudes a comfort zone feel. The visual delight of the interior space couples well with a spectacular view of the Kolkata skyline from the restaurant.¬†

The cream de la cr√®me among the restaurant‚Äôs USP's is the outdoor seating arrangement of about 5-6 tables. Although open to air, yet it is air-conditioned to beat the muggier months. Incidentally during the clement months it would be a pronounced experience to soak in Kolkata‚Äôs mild winters. The corner verandah serves hookah for the y-generation and for those who love to smoke with their tipple it is a rather comfortable space. I loved the incipient November chill all through the evening in the outdoor! It would be an idyllic place all through the wintery months to soak in the chilled weather.

Though I am not a cocktail loving person, I ventured out to try some of their swinging concoctions. First shot was the famed Manga.

Sweet and Tangy Vodka based cocktail, it had an all desi flavour burst from the Aam Panna as the main base with its signature cumin flavour to follow. It comes in a kullar shaped glass with etched in a typical Hinglish font that sets the tone for a fusion evening. 
Next, was the more stylized ‚ÄòMad Men‚Äô a Bourbon base with Coffee Orange and a whiff of Rosemary spray, which, I really liked and got myself a double dose.

 
 

Getting headier, I tried out the Copper Monkey, lo and behold but predictably it was in a copper mug. I quite liked the passion fruit flavour and the hint of mint in it worked well.

¬†

Although christened as ‚ÄòMonkey Bar‚Äô one would be rather surprised to see a super array of fusion food alongwith some very innovative desi leaning twisters. One look at the menu and I was instantly attracted to the Laal Maas Phulka Tacos, Radish cake bites for its novelty, Mobar Caramelized Pork ribs for its slow cooking and the Butterfly Chicken for the signature shells. 
The Laal Maas in the Phulka Tacos was juicy and well done, served on a ¬†Bao Stand for appeal as well as to function as a 'hold on'.  The meat was unique in flavour and spiced up enough to support its Laal Maas Status! 

 

The radish /mooli cake bites were indeed a experience though one really cannot make out if radish is used as the main filling ingredient unless told. The Tempura batter and the black bean sauce make up for the frunchy bite and flavour of the Radish bites.

 

The caramelized rib was succulent and smokey, living up the 6-hour slow cooked traditional method. So was it's house sauce quite zesty and lip smacking. 

 

The Butterfly Chicken was perhaps the only dish, which I would give the pass, though a visual delight again. I was lead to believe or was expecting a Butter Chicken filling. Maybe that is a good idea too.

Overall this place is not all just ambience, though that feeling is certainly overwhelming and sets up the mood. The service, food and the liquid chemistry in the cocktails are commendable too.

Monkey Bar | Kaustav Nayak | 1276373 | 5.0 | 2016-11-25 09:43:48 | With its French windows giving a glimpse of both the Victoria Memorial as well as the Howrah Bridge, the ambient lighting, great music, brick walls, a gorgeous skylight, a section that projects black and white motion picture and an apparently messy but ultimately symmetric seating arrangement that will please the OCD in you, Monkey Bar is hands down the best looking place in town. The ambiance, crowd and the location itself (9th floor of the Fort Knox building in Camac Street) itself demands a high rating. But it outdoes itself in the food department as well.¬†

The tiger beef is an instant classic. Perfectly cooked and just the right amount oily, this is a dish that I will highly recommend. The chettinad chicken samosas on the other hand flattered to deceive, definitely not worth the high price. Reddy's chicken popcorn though is a whole different story : small pieces of chicken fried with curry leaves, ¬†sesame, coconut shreds and a concoction of south Indian spices.¬†The name that will pique your interest however is the butter chicken khichudi. Bengali style sticky rice cooked amalgamated with Punjabi style chicken butter masala, this is a dish that has sharp flavors very well attuned for the Indian tongue. I absolutely loved it! 4 small cups containing curd, ghee, pickle and papad are given as accompaniments.¬†
¬†

And just everything else, their dessert section is more than competent too. While the snicker bar with its milk chocolate ganache on a crunchy almond base and a chocolate cake below may feel a tad too sweet, they provide a coffee ice cream to go with it and together the balance is delectable. The gondhoraj lime tart was more in my wheelhouse : the tangy lime curd really stood out. If I have to recommend one among these two I'd say take a leap of faith, ditch the always reliable chocolate and go for the tart.¬†

Here's to next time. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pratik Sensarma | 10848301 | 5.0 | 2016-11-22 20:50:17 | A too good place to b with your friends...had been there some days before...services are good...and ambience... Wat a place... After a long time had been to such an awesome place like this... One could have a marvelous view of the city Kolkata... Specially our Victoria memorial and cathedral Church...the foods are very tasty ...starting from Manga , tiger beef, tikki of joye to other cocktails  everything was perfectly made and served. Then lastly the desserts...the chocolate cake mainly... Was the best... Really had an too good time..keep it up guys  :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Anusreea Paul | 2257306 | 4.5 | 2016-11-21 12:13:39 | The famous brand is finally here in Kolkata. It's been three months since they opened doors on Camac Street and there's been no looking back for them :)
Had the opportunity to visit the place thanks to a bloggers meet. This is the brain child of chef Manu Chandra, the team, the food is crafted by him. The place epitomizes awesomeness in every inch. The place is big, read huge!! The huge old school windows lead you to stare at the city landscape with wide open eyes. They have an open seating arena, high rise chairs and comfortable sofas to choose from. They serve alcohol and hookah. They even arrange for sundowners on wintry afternoons, for you to sip on their lavish cocktails and enjoy the sun going down. The Victoria Memorial and the Howrah bridge are visual delights. They have their pub rules hence it is better to read them up and visit!
The crafted menu for the afternoon:

**Drinks**

Copper Monkey: Served in a copper vessel with a ¬†chunk of orange came this cocktail, whiskey based.

Manga: The ever famous drink, vodka based, a concoct of vodka and mango pulp.

Hipster Smash: Smacking name, and a refreshing drink! The array of colors are incredible. Mix of watermelon juice, a huge chunk of frozen watermelon and vodka.

Old Fashioned on Camac: The name might sound synonymous with rum but it is a whiskey based cocktail.

**Food**

Kerala Red Rice: A vegetarian and a non-vegetarians' delight! Thick red rice mixed with southern spices. It's spicy, it's crunchy, and it's tangy!!

Tiger Beef: The best, best, best beef is served here!! A bowlful of spicy meaty delight!! The shredded, well cooked, perfectly spiced beef served as the best chakna with the cocktails. Quite filling, good in quantity. Must order and highly recommended.

Butterfly Chicken: The outer coatings are designed like butterflies. Fried to perfection, oil less, the butterfly winged shaped cups are visual delights. Filled inside the cups are shredded chicken mixed in a nice sauce. Recommended for the sheer taste, intensity of the dish, and the efforts behind the perfect butterfly wings!

Shammi Sliders: These little burgers are lovely to look at. They do not fill you up completely yet leave you quite satisfied. The minced meat patties are perfect and there's no saucy drips. You actually do not mess yourself up eating this. Accompanied with some house special fries served inside a cute monkey bar wrapper.

Tikki of Joy: Quite a big hit down south, they decided to include it in their Kolkata menu as well. Huge chunks of bhetki frie to perfection. Served with onion rings and mint chutney. Crispy, ample fish in every mouthful, not oily at all.

Lal Maas Phulka Tacos: even sized parathas half rolled like rolls, filled with minced juicy meat. The meat is tender and you would feel like you are eating a roll, Kolkata style!!

**Desserts**

Gondhoraj Lime Tart: Tad a bit too bitter if eaten without the entire chunk. The idea is take a bit of the biscuit base, the creme, the lemon curd, the pistachio cake, and the raspberry sugared petals. And you could keep eating that and stare into the dreamy wintry sky line. But make sure to get a window seat..:)

Old Monkey Signature Chocolate Cake: What is a chocolate if it does not make you high!!! Well, this one sure does...a huge chunk of chocolate bar sprinkled with praline and caramel sauce. Served with a little scoop of ice cream...aaahhh never felt better!!¬†

Guys, agar aap Monkey Bar nahi gaye to please jaldi jaiye...it's waiting for you!! The coolest place in town to rock and roll. Try their karaoke nights or their usual dining hours, you will not be disappointing!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Suruchi Bhawsinghka | 1140387 | 3.0 | 2016-11-21 09:59:22 | The amount of tax,service charge vat, and wat not they are adding is insane.I have been to so many resto ,trust me this place is not worth it.I would rather sit in a five-star hotel lounge to spend around 5k between 4 ppl. If you leave aside the taxes you would always want to visit this place .Loved d simple decor(specially the huge windows ) perfect place to chill with friends and enjoy your drink.Snacks are average .Guys pls check ur taxes ...u r being unreasonable !!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Prarthana Roy | 1683183 | 3.5 | 2016-11-20 21:42:56 | Firstly , very much overpriced ! But fell in love with their decor and view .. food is overpriced according to their portion and most importantly they don't taste sound to be priced that much ! And coming to tax .. 1000 bucks ?! U will surely be left with a whole in ur pocket .. recommended for once , strictly ! |

Monkey Bar | Dhawal Pratap SIngh | 442772 | 3.5 | 2016-11-14 14:34:01 | The place has excellent ambience and definitely scores well on the food quality. However, the portions are really small adding on to the already heavy cost. Instead of 1500 for 2, its a place where you will incur Rs1500 per person. Plus the taxes are a lot on the pocket. Our regular bill of Rs 4800 had Rs2000 worth of taxes amounting to a total of Rs 6800! Paying 40% tax on top of my bill is not something I was looking forward to. |
 
Monkey Bar | Supriya Baid | 34842096 | 5.0 | 2016-11-13 20:55:15 | One of the best ambience i have ever seem in kolkata! Fabulous üëå great crowd. Good servers. Well maintained. Lovely presentation of food. Hookah love üíï keep it up guys ‚úå |
 
Monkey Bar | Shruti Keshri | 12428511 | 1.0 | 2016-11-08 22:26:50 | Pathetic place, the food quantity is so less, waiters don't understand anything, once you order the order only comes when you die hungry. We waited for  bill for almost 14 mins and then left, the waiter came running out to get the bill, and top of that the bill was wrong, they charged us for we didn't order also.

Over priced, lazy, pathetic place. Never visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | The Calcutta Foodie | 36569739 | 4.5 | 2016-11-08 11:14:50 | Monkey bar is the newest attraction in town and rightly so, talking about interiors the biggest hit is the huge Windows showing the skyline of Calcutta, it's a breathtaking view from the 9th floor. 

The menu is quite innovative and the concoctions in terms of the cocktails are pretty darn good.

The food doesn't disappoint at all the butterfly chicken was crispy and juicy which is very rare a combination and the pork ribs had a smokey barbecue flavour to them and were very, very soft. 

The place is slightly expensive, but, with that ambience and quality, it's hardly an issue. |
 
Monkey Bar | Ms_WalkingShoes | 1193155 | 4.5 | 2016-11-07 18:24:29 | Read d reviews on Zomato n planned to pop over to dis place.
The interiors..ambience...music..crowd n d staff is absolutely perfect.
The view is jus mindblowing n d breeze is so soothing.
We ordered Prawn Pil Pil which was yum..
The Beef Pickle and the Pork Sausages were a bit disappointing.
We had two beers and a virgin mojito.
D thing dat was bit disappointing was dat our bill was 2368Rs...out of which 535Rs was jus all kinda tax.
Overall this place is one of d best plc to hangout around. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rishav Dey | 193398 | 4.0 | 2016-11-07 14:01:53 | Six of us landed up at Monkey Bar on a Saturday evening. It was a nightlife hotspot at 19:30 hours already and we had to wait almost 40 minutes before we could be seated. We were ushered in and given the offer of crowding around the bar which we accepted.
The ambiance was great. Music was good and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Making a conversation wasn't the easiest thing to do but at places like this that is quite expected. 
We kicked off the evening with a portion of Loaded Nachos, 4 helpings of Pack a Punch, one Old Fashioned on Camac with bourbon and one Mama's Girl with Absolut. The last two we had to settle for because Toast to Calcutta couldn't me made due to lack of availability of gin. The nachos were appetizing and I liked my old fashioned with bourbon but the accompanying almond biscotti was too sweet for me. The pack a punch was good but the Mama's Girl was not appreciated by any one.
The Aam Admi Eggs went down well with me. It reminded me of the bhel puri walas and their chutneys. The eggs were soft but firm. It made me crave a bit for the soft, gooey and runny yolk. The Hispter Smash was nice but the Tipsy Sherbet was quite interesting for me because I have always wondered how alcohol would blend with rose syrup and Mo Bar did a wonderful job. The Copper Monkey was a bit like a fruity mint julep but I did like it. The Not so Vanilla was not quite my kind of cocktail with the creamy texture so I exchanged that for the Hipster Smash with a friend. The best cocktail according to me was by far the Mad Men. All the flavours combined really well and complimented each other beautifully. Coffee and orange always work well but the subtle rosemary was a delightful addition. 
The duck pita pockets were great. Oriental flavours in between a pita was an unusual combination but the pita seemed to go quite well with the duck in five spice and the hoisin sauce. The Kerala Beef Fry was nice but I would have loved to have it with Malabar parotta instead of the bread they served. The smoked chicken pizza was decent too. 
The service was very good. There was a period in between when we were very unhappy with the excruciatingly slow service but our server was extremely apologetic about it and cited the reason of a busy weekend evening for the barmen. It was understandable as far as I was concerned. The value for money is perhaps a bit on the lower side and I would say Mo Bar is a moderately expensive place. The food was mostly good. The drinks too were mostly very good. And I couldn't get enough of the Mad Men. So I will return for the Mad Men and to try the beef bulgogi, tiger beef, Goan chrizo pav, baked brie and prawn ghee roast. Recommended if one doesn't mind spending a bit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sharan Bansal | 394157 | 5.0 | 2016-11-06 18:14:14 | Amazing new York style ambience in Kolkata. Great hospitality and service! We had an awesome Sunday lunch with friends over champagne , rum punch and beer ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sahil Islam | 1001945 | 5.0 | 2016-11-05 00:53:16 | Lovely place with nice decor ...... The pricing was excellent given the quality of the food even for non drinkers it is a not to be missed spot loved the duck pita pocket and snicker bar |
 
Monkey Bar | Harsh Agarwal | 615445 | 4.5 | 2016-11-03 22:40:49 | Food, decor and ambience is top notch. Kolkata has got a Gem restaurant and bar. The view and seating is made for each other.

For the egg lovers-"Aam aadmi eggs. Sheer brilliant dish. Must try if you visit.

The staff needs to be a little polite and polished. Lack hospitality and softness. If they can improve upon this, it will be no doubt the finest joint in the city.

Will surely visit again. |
 
Monkey Bar | Santanu Adhikary | 31601287 | 4.5 | 2016-11-02 15:01:09 | Awesome ambience. ..mesmerising view of our beloved quintessential kolkata. ..love the taste of butterfly chicken and nachos with whisky. .. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul | 20537314 | 4.0 | 2016-10-31 13:45:15 | Great food, smooth shisha and pleasant staff at a great location. The food served was fresh and tasty. Though the open area for shisha is a little congested. This is a perfect alternative to bar exchange since the staff is very pleasant. Had an outing with 8 of team mates on October 25, costed 7.5 k excluding alcohol. Will be my preferred location for after work outings as long as the staff is pleasant. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pooja Marwaha | 1981882 | 4.0 | 2016-10-30 23:11:30 | One of the new places opened in Calcutta. This place has a great view of the city with good music. When I say good music, I mean music in the background and you can hear the person sitting opposite to you. The service is spot on. The servers attend to you first and do not chit chat in a corner. Now the food, ordered a farmers pizza which was good enough for an evening snack. The best thing that happened during the evening was the hookah. It was so smooth yet gave the kick. After a very long had really good hookah. The price pinch is moderate too. Would definitely visit more often now. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Agrawal | 1902980 | 4.5 | 2016-10-30 00:43:02 | Since its opening, have been there couple of times already. The evening view of the city is definitely one of the the ups of the place.¬†
The ambience is awesome and the right kind of classy touch interiors makes you want to come n relax with friends.¬†
The mocktails were good, and some dishes mentioning special mention are Chilli Cheese dragons, Med platter, Falafel Sliders and Mobar Laksa.¬†
Thanks Avantika for bringing the Monkey to town. :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Divya Khettry | 1930204 | 4.0 | 2016-10-29 12:09:30 | Finally the Monkey swings East! Must day amazing ambience and view. Drinks were great too the only thing I didn't like here was the food its a little average. I also loved the music all my fav tracks were played. |
 
Monkey Bar | Tushar Goyal | 1881622 | 4.5 | 2016-10-29 10:47:35 | Unluckily I ended up to the place on a Thursday and it was a dry day there, but the food was phenomenal . The moment you see the menu you want to try everything .

We ordered loaded nacho was very good , beet and orange salad which was ok , kimchi baby potatoes is a must try.
For the mains I ordered paneer kichdi which was good and the soulful bowl chilly paneer was good too. 

Going to go again for the non- veg very soon . |
 
Monkey Bar | Komal Agarwal | 34017613 | 3.5 | 2016-10-27 19:38:37 | The only good part about this place was the ambience and picturesque settings. Food is nothing worth mentioning. The spaghetti pasta was bad. Spring rolls & nachos were okay. Among the drinks, I really liked the Virgin Mangaa. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pragya | 1712349 | 3.0 | 2016-10-26 16:50:18 | Ambience - Good

Monkey Bar | Sumitra Sharma | 34680967 | 4.0 | 2016-10-25 11:54:10 | hi,
Was there for lunch.ambience is very good and the moment I entered it felt like its a lovely place for a winter lazy afternoon date. very clean.As we went in a large group the service was a bit slow.I hope as the restaurant ages it will be sorted out.butter chicken khichdi was good.smoothies and drink were also good.I had tried prawn which was also very tasty.I loved the interior,very classy specially the open area to sit.should try once.

Monkey Bar | Chandramouli Daga | 15803042 | 4.0 | 2016-10-24 20:41:36 | A sensational space with a terrific view of the Calcutta skyline. While it is expensive and the cocktails might not cater to everyone, the food is experimantally delicious while the service is admirable. 

Happening! And how! |
 
Monkey Bar | Moumita Das Talukdar | 343640 | 4.0 | 2016-10-24 20:01:03 | Visited this place at Fort Knox building 9th floor- the new outlet to party with friends. Gorgeous interiors and a stellar reputation as a chain we went there with high expectations and we were satisfied.Spectacular view with good music and awsum food. Innovative cocktails , lipsmacking pork and beef dishes.A must try joint. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anurag Jaiswal | 1778047 | 4.5 | 2016-10-24 18:14:19 | Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox building. The food & service are excellent. Ambiance is awesome. Per pax-Rs.1000 with drinks (inclusive of taxes) |
 
Monkey Bar | Sanjay Bhowmik | 29528004 | 4.0 | 2016-10-23 23:36:21 | I think I would rate this place 95% purely for the ambience and the view....the truly quintessential bar and cafe where you can have an awesome conversation at an awesome side table with an awesome view of the metropolis named Kolkata that I am yet to see anywhere in this city....truth be told, I was bedazzled and enamoured by the view....a whole 6/5!!!

Then comes the hard reality....for the few drinks (7), couple of coffee and a few bites, it was almost ‚Çπ4.2k....time to pay for the view!!!!....maybe a tinge more so 3.5/5....but the few hours spent are worth sitting there provided the company / conversation is good....

Nothing to write home about the food taste, just an avg 3.5/5

In the evening they have a good lighting set up and inspite of the crowd, every table and it's occupants had their own space and not intruded upon....it didn't feel cluttered like other such hallmark Kolkatan joints....would have gone for a 4.5/5 but they totally managed to screw that up with thumping music, which could have been easily done through the softer and low volume lounge music!!!...killed the evening ambience....if the idea was to attract the vibrant gen then they missed the fact that there were a whole lot of couples and a few bunch who were engrossed in their own conversation and seemed a bit irritated with the thumping bass....so here's a 3/5 for ruining the awesome layout and view....

If I would ever come again, it would be for the view and the window seats....but guys, do get some class in the music, the environment should provide for individual space, the layout, lighting, setting and ambience are awesome but your music settings are truly questionable, at least this time round!!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Gupta | 29595954 | 3.0 | 2016-10-23 14:58:41 | I didnt have the food since i wanted north indian cuisine and they dnt serve the same where as Zomato says they serve north indian.... ambience was excellent.... |

Monkey Bar | Munmun Banerjee Ghosh | 13780291 | 5.0 | 2016-10-21 09:22:56 | Excellent food!Good cocktails.Even better music.And the best part of Monkey Bar is the view.Perfect blend to fall in love with the city,all over again.Must-visit!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sunanda Ghosh | 2720210 | 4.0 | 2016-10-20 12:21:51 | The newest addition to Camac Street, Monkey bar holds the promise of becoming one of the coolest hangouts for GenY. Situated on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building, it offers a panoramic view of the city through huge glass windows and what's more there's even arrangement for outdoor seating. The decor is charming and an awesome background score makes the ambience perfect for chilling out with your friends over great food and drinks. Firstly we ordered a butterfly chicken and duck pita pockets. The chicken was delicious and crispy tossed with bell peppers, chilli flakes and stuffed in crunchy butterfly shells and the duck meat marinated with spices and packed inside soft pita bread created fireworks in our mouths. We also went for a smoked chicken, chicken salami and harissa pizza which was superb, to say the least. There was another Hearty bowl, a heartwarming chicken broth with bean sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, flat noodles and bokchoy sprinkled with chilli oil. We finished off with Mobar Sundae Sandwich, an ice cream cake with nuts layered with nutella and tutti fruti. We also tried their hookah and the shisha is really good and strong. The service is more of less..efficient and the staff polite..but the pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side. They recently acquired their bar license, so would love to drop in again for a taste of their cocktails! |
 
Monkey Bar | Pamela Nandi | 2821382 | 3.0 | 2016-10-20 01:06:16 | No doubt this place has an amazing ambience with an indoor and outdoor seating area styled in the form of british pub, but food and service is very very poor.¬† We went on ashtami night with friends, they took about an hour to prepare the chicken stacked as saslik to grill it. Once served, the dish was just tasteless. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sunrita Sarkar | 804376 | 5.0 | 2016-10-18 22:44:36 | Hi, if you love Calcutta , good music(and by good music I mean led zeppelin and pink flyod and classics as such ) and a brilliant view of Calcutta, this is the place to be. 

We ordered a pack up punch, Sangria and a 100 pipers based cocktail. All three were pretty different and pretty well made. 

We didn't order any food as we were so engrossed in the decor and view. 

The hospitality was brilliant. 

Do give it a visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Aritra Roy | 145459 | 4.5 | 2016-10-17 22:31:23 | Already visited twice in such a short span of opening its doors in Kolkata, Monkey Bar has been fabulous on both occasions. Situated on the top floor of Fort Knox, it provides a magnificent view of the Kolkata skyline with Victoria Memorial, St Pauls Cathedral, Hooghly bridge and the 42 which is the tallest building here.

The food has been great and is presented in a unique way. Ordered Chilli Cheese dragons, Mac and cheese croquettes, Butterfly chicken and Chicken Chimichurri on the first time along with Mangaa mocktail. On the repeat, we ordered Mobar caramel ribs, Tiger beef, Reddys popcorn chicken alongwith a Smoked chicken pizza. In drinks, we had copper monkey , house made ginger beer with a couple of KF ultras.

However special mention must go to the desserts, Snicker bar is just too good while Nolen gur creme brulee was delicious.
They have a small open air area for hookah as well. The service is prompt and the ambience is quite relaxing. The bar looks pretty while the music changes over time with comforting tracks during evening to partying ones as the night progresses on.

Overall, the Kolkata gastropub scene is proud to have Monkey bar in its lineup. Hope it gets better from here.Cant wait to visit soon again :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Rupsha Bhadra | 606325 | 4.5 | 2016-10-16 14:33:22 | Monkey bar in Delhi is a location that is a part of some very special memories so I had really high expectations from its Calcutta counterpart. It certainly did not disappoint. We ordered loaded chicken nachos, the butter chicken kichdi, smoked chicken pizza and others. The butter chicken khichdi was really impressive. So were the cocktails Maanga and Copper monkey. A little on the higher side when it comes to the pocket pinch, monkey bar did live up to all the expectations. And the view is just fantastic. |
 
Monkey Bar | Madhurya Sarkar | 6309371 | 5.0 | 2016-10-16 12:11:35 | Just loved it.
The ambiance, the playlist, the skyline view, the staff management, the food and everything is just superb of this pub. This is located in the 9th floor of Knox building opposite to Urban desi. We visited late afternoon but the best time would be to hit this place in the evening. This can be an ideal place to go a date with your partner :)
The view of St. Paul's Cathedral, Victoria Memorial and Hooghly Bridge adds flavour to their ambiance.
Coming to food we had kingfisher premium beer, chicken wings and chocolate lava cake. All of the dishes were value for money. Overall had an excellent experience.
Coming back soon :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Syed Murtaza Jafar | 32607152 | 5.0 | 2016-10-16 04:52:57 | Ok, so same night we visited The Great Booze Story and Monkey Bar, and I'll say Monkey Bar won big time. Just opposite Urban Desi (will visit soon), good collection of music, courteous and attentive staff, this is one venue that you would want to visit again. The ambience, the view of the The Victoria Memorial is just a sight to look at. Safe to say, I'll be coming back to this place soon |
 
Monkey Bar | Preity | 27451267 | 4.5 | 2016-10-15 21:30:28 | Rare does it happen that you get good food at a bar and by the ambience of this place i expected nothing different..but to my surprise it was a very delightful experience..superbbbb food..good music, not too loud so you can chit chat with your friends..and very courteous staff..overall a very good experience..definitely coming back and soon... |

Monkey Bar | Sankha Sengupta | 1733759 | 4.0 | 2016-10-14 17:13:36 | Been there yesterday night. Had soft to you guys, you people just amazed me by your friendly hospitality.
Specialty thanks to Joy you made my evening remarkable. Monkey people should be proud to have a manager like you. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rashmi Adhikary | 31014016 | 4.5 | 2016-10-14 14:26:12 | We visited Monkey Bar on Saptami evening, and had a spectacular time. The ambience is lively, the music is great, the decor very impressive and the service commendable.  
Now coming to the sumptuous meal; an assortment of drinks - whiskey, tequila, rum, virgin mojita, espresso -  was ordered with starters being Butterfly Chicken and Chicken Chapli. Yes, Butterfly Chicken is a definitely worth a try. In the main course, there was Aunty Vinnie's Berry Pulao. Tiger Beef was so delicious that two more dishes were ordered; this is must-try for beef lovers. This is the first place in Kolkata that I see so many beef dishes being offered. Galouti Killer was the other beef dish ordered and equally palatable. I had Mee Goreng which is an Indonesian dish of spiced noodles and got it topped with chicken. 
Overall, it was a great experience in this newly-opened gastropub. |
 
Monkey Bar | Piyush Dalmia | 15726652 | 4.5 | 2016-10-13 20:42:49 | Another fab newbie in the city

Talk about the Ambience, Food, Service or the Decor, it excels in all

Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building at Camac Street, it offers a spectacular view of the city
 
The Decor and Seating Arrangements are well made 

They got a separate smoking area which is quite airy, and has ample seating space as well

Shisha was pretty decent and lasted quite a while

Now lets talk about the protagonist here

Nachos were crisp and loaded with cheese, the Platter was appealing and featured variety of items whereas the mocktails were on fleek 

But things which really caught our attention were Spaghetti and Paneer Khidchi

While the former was extremely tasty, the latter is a MUST have dish for sure

All in all, it was a happy dining experience for us |
 
Monkey Bar | Arpita Agarwal | 998579 | 4.5 | 2016-10-13 12:39:47 | A new place in town, much awaited. Great ambience! The view is also super!! Maybe they should have had a slightly larger rooftop area. Food is decent too. The nachos were pretty good. The Manga is a must try!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sharmistha Mukherjee | 722185 | 4.5 | 2016-10-12 06:49:58 | If you are in Calcutta and love the skyline and a few drinks to go along with it on a hot, rainy or crisp evening this is the place to be. Monkey Bar in Calcutta is done up beautifully and affords you a view of the Victoria Memorial, St Paul's Cathedral and the Hoogly Bridge. The have cocktails and food over and above what they offer in other cities. The hipster smash is delicious to say the least. As was the bourbon cocktail with almond bitters... |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohit Suryawanshi | 36318376 | 5.0 | 2016-10-11 18:11:29 | My favourite lalmass Takos ,Pizza and Delicious Chillie cheese Dragon.
The friendliness of the staff seems genuine. I have never seen such good customer service as I experienced. |
 
Monkey Bar | FOODBUFFS | 987893 | 4.0 | 2016-10-11 11:16:14 | Visited on Ashtami night.Even though it was a good crowd,we managed to get a table immediately,courtesy to the experienced and efficient management team.There is an open-air seating which mainly caters to people ordering hookah or going there for a puff.Indoor seating is quite large.
Decor is akin to a British pub.Upholstery is comfortable.What allures you are those French windows through which you can catch a great glimpse of the city skyline,from the ninth floor.In the evenings there is muted lighting.Ambience is quite good.We heard some good old day soft music but as the night grew,the DJ started giving groovy yet classy numbers.
Service is warm and polite but there was a lack of professionalism.We were giving the same food order to two or three different men at times.The servers,even though quite courteous,were not quite clearly conversant about the food and beverages,unless asked upon.Details or any recommendations/suggestions were not given on their own.They need to more vocal  and well informed about every detail of the food when the order is being placed.
PAN RASNA HOOKAH-strong flavour,no choking but the smoke was quite weak,unlike to our liking.It was smooth but the smoke didnot last for an hour.It wasnot worth the price charged.Not satisfied.
BUTTERFLY CHICKEN-tastewise quite impressive.Chicken morsels were soft and had a sweet tangy taste.The sauce was pretty good and spicy and the butterfly shells were crispy,the whole presentation looked lovely.Three butterflies were there.
REDDY'S CHICKEN POPCORN-Well this dish took us to South India.Moderately sized chicken morsels deep fried in a batter having a crisp crunchy texture and the taste was so consistent in southern flavours,it tasted good.Curry leaves flavour was predominant and we liked it a lot to go for a second order.
CHICKEN CHIMICHURI-Chicken was soft.They were skewed up but the flavours were quite bland,didnot stand up to our expectations.Not impressive at all,this dish needs improvement.
MEDITERRANEAN PLATTER-Mixed comments.It was great in some parts,not so great in others.Chickpea fries were not so good to taste,seemed a bit too fried where the chickpea stuffing was too less.The pita breads were nice,soft,fluffy,buttered and nicely grilled,tasted good.Hummus was in great quantity,tastewise perfect but the babaghanoush didnot stand out in taste.Cheese filo wraps tasted good.They  had soft spinach with gooey cheese inside wrapped in rice papers and fried.Overall a good dish,you can give it a try if Mediterranean cuisine is your calling.
OLD MONK(EY) CHOCOLATE CAKE-Good.Cake was melt in mouth soft and creamy.Consistency of cream was smooth,light and fluffy.The dessert was classy,superb and hence recommended.
Foodwise we were not that satisfied as much as we were with their cocktails!!
Their BOURBON LIIT,MAD MEN and MAMA'S GIRL were just bang on!The bartender did a great job.The blend was great,the liquor gave a great kick,courtesy the good mixing.They were well balanced in flavours and the ingredients of the drinks very well complimented each other.Spices and mint went well with vodka,and coffee with whisky surely made a great pair.
We also ordered Heineken,Ginger ale and fresh lime soda which was usual.
As far as price is concerned,it is too high for the food and some cocktails! Quantity of food is very less,so doesnot justify the price and tastewise it didnot make a good mark.The cocktails had a price tag which was same as most gastropubs having a good establishment cost,yet they were high.
This pub is a must visit,esp for their awsome cocktails.The gastronome part needs improvement to call it a fair gastropub.Will visit again for sure owing to the overall good experience that we had,a good hangout place and to try other cocktails and entr√©es. |
 
Monkey Bar | Garima Poddar | 2714062 | 3.5 | 2016-10-10 23:22:48 | The ambience n decor is nice..I had ordered fr a peach icetea n it was quite refreshing..the chilli cheese dragon was nt that impressive n lacking chilli..onion n capsicum basically the description was amazing bt it was no where near that..nachos was average..spaghetti in red sauce was again average..green thai curry was really nice n d best part was d dessert mobar sundae sandwhch it was like love at first bite |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohit Misra | 1561408 | 4.5 | 2016-10-10 11:32:08 | Monkey bar has lived upto the expectations. With crazy ambience and amazing service, it just became my favourite destination in town. Also on a special note, Ripon out there was brilliant with his service. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rima Dhara | 1796261 | 2.5 | 2016-10-09 20:08:51 | Nothing great... service is very bad... food is ok.. ambiance is good ... but as a whole coz of service of of the worst place I have ever been.... will not try again ‚òπÔ∏è chicken wasn't fresh... very bad experience ... |
 
Monkey Bar | Sreyashi M. | 10853321 | 4.5 | 2016-10-09 19:05:16 | Visited today for lunch, and a had a lovely time! 
I suggest you get a table by the windows. The Kolkata skyline will definitely make your visit even more memorable. 
We tried the Maanga cocktail (5 stars, peeps!) with the Tiger Beef. I suggest you try both. Succulent meat with the zing of your drink makes for some very happy (read: tipsy) people. 
For mains, we tried the Mobar burger and it was heavenly! The Naga pork soulful bowl was fabulous too! Portions are great, flavour is gorgeous and staff is super sweet and nice. 
I hope you maintain what you've got going so I can visit again! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sudipto Mitra | 2401672 | 3.5 | 2016-10-09 09:00:39 | Nice decor , awsum view of the cityscape and great cocktails . Food is good to average with a twist and may not be liked by all.
We ordered pitchers of pack a punch,mangaa amd mohjito and the first is the best.

We stuck with finger food only and ordered 
Mushroom bruschetta(good),prawn pil pil(gr8), chicken churi(avg) and tiger beef(gr8)
Rounded everything off with aunty berry pulao which was delicious
 This a typical gastro bar with foot tapping music which is too loud at times, we had to ask it to be turned down.

The service could have been bettet and there  was confusion while seating. We were waiting at the bar for our table to be ready but some other guests jumped on that

Oh forgot to mention a outing here will surely burn a whole in your pocket |
 
Monkey Bar | Vedant Kabra | 2240676 | 4.5 | 2016-10-09 08:47:40 | I went to monkey bar last night and I was pretty surprised. Read all the reviews and thoroughly analysed the place in my mind before I went there (it's what I do). 
The guy at the front desk (I believe he was the owner) was phenomenal. So welcoming, so easy going and so 'approachable'. The one at the front desk is the face of any restaurant. He told us we'll have to wait for 40, but we got a table in 20. Told us we'll have to share the table - but eventually we didn't have to. 
I think seating right outside the kitchen + bar worked for us. Didn't have to wait for the food (the cheese drum, nachos and mushroom + truffle oil pizza are INSANE). Ordered quite a bit on the liquor front - barring the martini everything else was really good (fun presentation too!) (including the ginger beer). We had heard so much about the desserts - total let down though (chocolava cake with mint ice cream was terrible I must confess - Mezzuna gets the big ups here). 
The staff was pretty alright (looked a little confused at times). 
Monkey bar must work on guest management (but it is only a few weeks old so it's okay). Thoroughly impressed with the ambience (trumps Mezzuna and all the other hot spots in the city several times over), food, booze and service. 
This place has my highest recommendation. |
 
Monkey Bar | Argha Basu | 1892606 | 5.0 | 2016-10-08 15:46:45 | If you want to impress your girlfriend or wife . Just take her there . Take your seat next to the glass wall and enjoy the panaromic view of the Victoria memorial, Vidyasagar Setu and the Howrah Bridge.

Monkey Bar | Puja Das | 36272619 | 4.5 | 2016-10-08 12:52:12 | Bookmarks . ¬†It's got an amazing atmosphere with outdoor and indoor seating. Despite going on the weekend it gets the right amount of crowd that makes it a very happening place. Music was really good. We wanted to try a new cocktail, so we went for the ¬†toast to calcutta which was a little different and tasted quite good. Food on the other hand was quite unique. 
service is also impressed us. ¬† ¬†

The place is a little hard to find. But overall it's a nice place for the weekend chill! |
 
Monkey Bar | Tejash | 15384381 | 1.5 | 2016-10-08 11:33:48 | Visited this place on 7th October with friends. We were a group of 11 but there is no place for such big group there.  The table we were given was ideal for 7 but we had to squeeze in.  Repeated request for chair felt to deaf ears till such time my friend pulled up the bar chair from the adjacent table. They have limited staff and one server was alloted to the tables.  Needless to say the service was pathetic and totally unacceptable. Our order for beer and ginger ale took 30 mins and after repeated reminders it arrived.  The food is average with limited option for Vegetarian. No one wants to eat "baigan pakora " or " vada pav" at such a place.  We were charged for one item that was ordered but not served. On pointing the same the server "argued" that we didn't realise but it was indeed served to us.  In no mood to hang around any more we just paid and left.  While waiting down for our car we met others who too were very disappointed with the place. 

This will be one of those places in kolkata that will soon be ticked off based on word or mouth and customer experience because of shabby service and attitude of the people who run it. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anshuman Jalan | 31752408 | 2.0 | 2016-10-08 00:20:08 | Good atmoshpere ! Average food for vegie lovers ! Place to chill and soak in the music and buzz around . Nothing home to write about the food . And weekend and holidays . aVOID as unable to give service due to rush |
 
Monkey Bar | Darshana Rampuria | 2855224 | 3.5 | 2016-10-05 11:34:14 | So finally visited Monkey Bar ! The ambience is good as compared to What we get to see in Kolkata.. but apart from that nothing spectacular and surely cannot be compared to the one in Mumbai ! The food is Too average . We had ordered the Nachos - this one was a disaster , pesto spaghetti ( penne pasta wasn't there!!) - yet again very bland and just not up to the mark . Though tempura and mezze platter was good BUT the Coconut ice cream Dessert was FABULOUS SO an extra 0.50 points for that !! Food needs to be worked upon , staff is courteous ! Best wishes .. hoping my next visit be better and with no complains ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sujan Das | 36218418 | 4.5 | 2016-10-03 14:04:44 | I went this place with my friends and I would say this was amazing and was full packed in the weekend without liquor. There ambiance was very good and the music they place is also very nice . There drinks where also very good . They smoking and non smoking area also which was the best part of this place. Good place to spend with your friends. As we been to many other bars but I love this place as they have place to sit and there service was also excellent. They where pack but still there people know how to attend the gust which was very good in this bar. Pocket friendly and staff was excellent smiling and they working and they suggest also if you are new to this place and don't know what to order. I would suggest everyone for this place and sure you will be in love with this place. I basically tried everything on the menu (food and beverage), and yes it is all worth every penny
, I m fan of there menu and food, really enjoyed.¬†

Monkey Bar | Soul !! | 32140714 | 4.5 | 2016-10-03 08:50:51 | In a word, wonderful. We been to Delhi Monkey but this is the best one with wonderful view. 
One thing we really missed the Foosball) 
But no matter we had great time, fantastic food, we order lot many things forget the name but pizza and starters are yumm, drinks are also really nice
Staff were very welcoming too.

So keep good work guys !! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sarat | 8743511 | 3.0 | 2016-10-03 01:16:59 | ambience is good.. was excited to reach the place.. view n open air is also impressive.. u get a glimpse of the Victoria memorial
Although can't talk about the cocktails(coz we wet on 2nd oct, dry day), but we had the copper monkey mocktail and a ginger beer, we were very happy with both
But sadly food was extremely disappointing.. taste as well as quality is not upto the mark.. ordered the much talked about chicken butterfly, too sweet, no flavour of chicken n tasted Lyk beans on toast
Second ordered the spicy tomato spaghetti, worst I hav ever had, tasted like Maggi with tomato
Butter chicken khichadi was good,,, good innovation
Snickerbar, dessert, was well mind blowing if u hav a sweet tooth.. very nice and balanced taste
But the whole dining experience was not satisfactory |
 
Monkey Bar | Nikita Ramgarhia | 903737 | 2.5 | 2016-10-01 10:11:42 | An over hyped place.
The only plus points are the ambience and the service.
The hookah is average and food simply disappoints.
The vada pao is good.
The Mac and cheese croquettes have peas in them..like who does peas with cheese and Mac..
Too bad with the experimentation guys..
And the potato rackett is also very bland.
Galauti is average..
You guys are better in other cities I have heard..so pls improve in Kolkata |
 
Monkey Bar | Bindu | 36159071 | 3.5 | 2016-09-29 00:55:19 | At last chef manu chandra with his concept of monkey bar has entered in Kolkata.but sorry to say the food and service has dissapointed on comparison with the monkey bars in bombay and bangalore.
Need to check before its too late its my first experience but once more will love to try so that they can still improvise. |
 
Monkey Bar | Harish Todi | 1076456 | 2.0 | 2016-09-28 00:28:12 | The place is worst ever in all places that I do visit. What it seems from outside is not at all from inside. It's totally a different one and thats very disappointing for me. The hookah was so bad that I just left it after once. It was all a waste of money for me and that too a huge waste as it is very costly as per their brand name , but it's sad to say that it couldn't carry it'd brand name at all. |
 
Monkey Bar | Hardik Daga || Kolkata Epicurean | 9516701 | 4.0 | 2016-09-26 23:52:06 | Location-Fort knox building(9th floor),Camac street.

Finally "Monkey bar" has opened its gate to kolkata.After establishing itself in Mumbai,Delhi and Bangalore its opening in kolkata was much awaited.This place is totally a fresh take on gastrobar culture.As we entered we were totally astonished with the beauty of this place.The best part about this place was the swanky interiors and the dazzling view.The menu was mouthwatering and creation of one of the finest chef Manu Chandra.But along with whole lot of positive aspects this place has its negative side too and that is its service and price.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is extremely calm and soothing.The interiors are extremely high-toned.The place is divided into two sections(Smoking and Non Smoking area)which is appreciated.And atlast for this segment,we can bet that this place has the best view in comparison to any of the eateries in Kolkata.

Service-We were extremely disappointed with the service at this place.The staff was extremely confused with our seating.They took about 15 minutes to make us sit and also the table on which we were seated was already reserved by someone due to which we have to change our table in between.We also have to urge them many a times to serve us water and take the order for the food.But on the other side we saw that the staff was trained very well with the dishes and helped us to choose the right dishes according to our starvation.

Food-The food at this place was good in taste but what astonished us the most was their presentation,it was just praise-worthy.We had-
1:Med platter
2:Spicy panner bhurji buns
3:Chilli cheese dragons

Among them our favourite was "Med platter".We also had sheesha at this place which we find extremely expensive.It cost us around 800+taxes.

Food-4/5
Service-3/5
Ambiance-4.5/5

This place is a must visit for experiencing its Ambiance and food oresentation.üòÉüòÉ |
 
Monkey Bar | Ritwika Pal | 172912 | 4.0 | 2016-09-26 10:27:27 | Woo another gastropub in town, I was super excited to explore this new place. Unfortunately they not yet started with alcohol. But yes for compensation they have this Non alcoholic beer in their menu card. Which is more like a ginger ale.¬†
Food is awesome we tried Sticky Korean Chicken Wings and Prawn Pil Pil for which is can give 5/5. |

Monkey Bar | Vikash Kumar Singh | 32056738 | 2.0 | 2016-09-25 23:21:32 | Went to this place on 25th of September. The best part of this hotel is the view of Victoria + Vidyasagar Setu. Food is ok types. Service needs to improve. Didnt like that much. |
 
Monkey Bar | Shakshi Bajaj | 34222951 | 4.0 | 2016-09-25 21:50:03 | Had recently visited the place.  Ambience was really good.  Soothing music and ample space worked well for me.  All the people were very courteous and response was very quick. We ordered nachos,  potato with rachlette cheese and pizza.  The food was yummmm. We asked for out of the menu toppings for pizza and they were more than happy to serve.  It was a pleasant experience. |
 
Monkey Bar | Samrat Banerjee | 984442 | 3.0 | 2016-09-25 18:48:36 | Visited the place on 24Sep. A mix of pro's and cons. Remarkably expensive, considering service is yet to reach premium standards. Yet to get a bar license, staff seems confused about where to seat you if you walk in as a couple. While the outdoor sitting layout is nice, it's primarily used as a hookah space by boisterous youngsters, and the seating layout is remarkably cramped. Service also is a minus here with the server not asking or serving water if not called to do so. Portions are quite small against the charges. Chicken Chimichuri was good, folks lovers which was 3 cutlets of bhekti coated and fried was ok. The mushroom pizza was definitely a let down. With 2 soft drinks the tab came to ‚Çπ1650+. Not worth a revisit soon. |
 
Monkey Bar | Abhishek Agarwal | 2897244 | 3.5 | 2016-09-25 03:13:53 | Was on the bucket list since it opened... So
We ordered a hookah but it failed my expectations... We tried out the tacos which was really nice... Service was on the slower side.... Definitely a lot to improve..
But then having ur food wit hookah nd Victoria memorial to look over.. The view is breathtaking..
But u need to live up to the name...
Hope to b back soon.... Nd wish to see a Better Trained Monkeyüëç |

Monkey Bar | Shourya Sengupta | 2357486 | 4.5 | 2016-09-23 21:51:57 | Brilliant food! Loved the wide choice of meat. Please keep up the good work! Look forward to having the Galouti Killer, next time since it was not available. |
 
Monkey Bar | Siddhi Newatia | 3761881 | 3.0 | 2016-09-23 21:24:05 | Amazing ambience..very spacious, drinks menu could Hav had more variety..hated the mangaa drink..i found it too sour..the pizza and chilli cheese dragons were good. |
 
Monkey Bar | Harsh Bathwal | 1481844 | 3.5 | 2016-09-21 23:42:47 | Visited here for the first time. The food menu is different from what you come across usually in other restaurants. I think it's a perfect date spot as it has a beautiful Victoria building's view which looks amazing at night. Also the music was superb.
Pocket pinch : 600-700 per head. ( Food and mocktail) |
 
Monkey Bar | Shikha Ojha | 2112728 | 4.5 | 2016-09-18 01:48:05 | Amazing decor and awesome food. They had an outdoor sitting too which had a big screen playing Mickie and Minnie black and white cartoon synchronized with the songs being played. The cost is on the higher side but if you want to pamper yourself or people you love, this is the place to be. The amazing view is icing on the cake. |
 
Monkey Bar | Utsav Agarwal | 31137221 | 1.5 | 2016-09-17 22:49:13 | There is a difference in Bangalore wen it compares to Kolkata one , seriously don't no d reason but it needs to upgrade it very soon as in Bangalore. 
Specifically, the property is pretty old for a brand like dis 
According to me Monkey bar is just not another lounge but a more of a culture which in itself |
 
Monkey Bar | Arnav Jhunjhunwala | 22857974 | 5.0 | 2016-09-16 21:28:37 | The best place to hangout now. Food quality is excellent and many of the dishes aren't available anywhere in Kolkata. The key lime pie is unbelievable and a must have each time you go. |
 
Monkey Bar | Tanya Sen | 496614 | 5.0 | 2016-09-15 00:44:28 | The moment you walk in to this restaurant you're going to notice the long french windows and ofcourse the most beautiful view which includes victoria memorial. The ambience is lovely, very warm and urban. We ordered Aam Pannas, Tiger beef, Prawn Ghee Roast, Pepper Calamari. All of them were to die for. For dessert we ordered Nolen gurer creme br√ªl√©e. Yumm yumm!! I would totally come again. Loved itüòä |
 
Monkey Bar | Sourav Mukherjee | 306717 | 4.5 | 2016-09-14 11:38:19 | Finally they have arrived in Kolkata after rocking Delhi , Mumbai , Bangalore etc. and a few of Corporate Monkeys could muster the courage and had enough stock of lame excuses (for residential purposes only) to visit this joint on the lazy Saturday afternoon last week. Very conveniently located at Camac Street , innovative food & drinks menu like Kerala Rice , Butterfly Chicken , Prawn Pil Pil and many more.¬† Personally I loved the ginger beer. It was a full house and it is nice to see that City of Joy has lapped up the Monkey Bar and the legendary versatile gastronomical journey of Kolkata has just added yet another feather . Must visit joint for foodies and a great place to unwind. Wishing luck and Highly recommended !!!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Siddhartha Chowdhary | 211170 | 4.0 | 2016-09-14 00:31:42 | Dim lights and chic interiors. A totally fresh take on gastropub culture. The place was almost full when we entered so 9 of us had to accommodate on a smaller table. They weren't serving alcohol today, and for the next few days also they are keeping the bar closed. we had to compromise on that and had to order the virgins. We had the much hyped 'maanga' which was nice and refreshing. Homemade ginger beer was good. Brownie cookie shake wasn't available. For starters we had chilli cheese dragons, cheese filled cigar rolls with spicy garlic sauce, the sauce was amazing. Rock Corn tempura was good, crisp and the teriyaki sauce was appropriately done. Loaded nachos was amazing. Potato with raclette which was fried potatoes topped with stringy mozzarella cheese, was basic and slightly spiced toped with pickled jalape√±os. We also ordered two types of pizza , roasted zucchini with parmesan and tomatoes and the other, mushrooms with truffle oil. I loved the mushroom one over the zucchini one. But the pizza looked a bit messy and wasn't also evenly crisp. Overall the service was spontaneous and amiable. I liked the overall experience though. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Chopra | 34103337 | 4.5 | 2016-09-13 20:44:04 | Monkey Bar is a grown up version of a slightly more casual neighborhood bar. With about 300+ gastro pubs in India it is only a matter of time when people start aping. The Calcutta version is setting it apart from the rest of the so called gastro pubs.

We had the good fortune of going to the private opening of Monkey Bar Kolkata on the 1st September, 2016. It was a small party for about a 100 people. The mood was up beat and there was a sense of relief and satisfaction on the staff who were hosting us. It has taken Monkey Bar Kolkata a little over 8 months to complete the restaurant.

The staff is from all across the country. This makes for some good interaction with them ‚Äì that is if you care to chat them up. The cocktails are more involved. There is reasonable work that is done to create the drinks behind the counter. Work as in ingredients have been mixed and labor have been put in to create a concoction or mixes. Not just opening bottles and squirting premixes in a shaker and serving things up. Almost like an artisan touch. The bases are fermented in house; you can see the large glass jars filled and sitting happy on the bar counter.

To begins with the view is something you must visit let alone anything else. Add the food and you have method to mayhem. The care that goes in the food here is evident when you have your first bites. With Chef Manu Chandra at the helm of the kitchen things are definitely going to have certain standards in terms of flavor and quality. There is always going to be a reason behind why what ever has been done to the food in the kitchen here at Monkey Bar.

Expect massive flavors and good service. In fact it is so good to see the city opening up to the kinds of Monkey Bar. This is a place where you can come in and kick back with friends on a weekend. This is one tree that we two monkeys are happy to call home. |
 
Monkey Bar | Jayeeta Basu | 360426 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 21:01:52 | So finally Kolkata gets Monkey Bar!! 
I have always loved the Bangalore  and the Mumbai Monkey Bar because of the ambience.  
First day, the space and the view is amazing!! They had a very limited drinks menu considering first day. I had Toast to Calcutta, Manga and Copper Grin. Toast to Calcutta was refreshing, adding smoke gondhoraj lebu,  it tasted even better.  Manga is something I have drank before.  Copper Grin was okay. 
Let's get into the food menu.  Prawn ghee roast,  Vada Pav,  Keema Pav the menu took me back to Bombay and South. 
I had the Korean sticky wings,  since I already came to Monkey Bar  after having dinner,  I sticked to one starter and drinks!
I am planning to head back to Monkey Bar pretty soon for full fledged meal and lot of Toast to Calcutta! 
Please stock the bar as it is extremely disappointing to come to Monkey Bar and sit with limited choices in terms of alcohol. |
 
Monkey Bar | Arushi Dhupia | 1597321 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 19:14:22 | Monkey Bar is on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building on camac. Visit in the evening and if you're sitting by the window panes, you can see the Victoria Memorial, lights twinkling from The 42, and the outline of a part of the Parama flyover. It's so cool! 
The music is good and the place has a very funky feel to it. The food is good, not excellent. 
Loved the pizza and the Med platter.  Corn kernels were okayish. 
The Loaded Nachos were Brilliant!! Lots of sour cream and Mexican beans and fully loaded as the name suggests! No other places in kolkata (apart from the Big Nachos at |
 
Monkey Bar | Shhashee Churiwala | 2053496 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 23:48:39 | The newest hub in kolkata with different design and fresco depicting old kolkata. The giant size windows showing the serene skyline of the city. Exhaustive menu with both indian and international cuisine with a twist. Prompt service , great tasting dishes both starters and mains accompanied humble pricing. A great place to kill your hunger. All in all good experience after a long time. A must visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Aihik Barua | 1850614 | 3.5 | 2016-09-11 22:10:16 | This review might change. This post is influenced mostly due to the nonavailability of alcohol , and I did see two or three bottles of liquor , anyway , about the interiors and location , bloody superb amazing selection , love it , would suggest it anybody , the bartenders ( coke tenders üòÇ) seemed cocky , but it's a relief to see a high end restaurant serving beef, that's fresh and the it was good actually , would go again for the booze ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Mansi Tulshan | 33240285 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 21:17:40 | Went there in the evening today to check out all the hype surrounding it. Guess what! Wasn't disappointed at all. We took a seat right next to the window(yes, I have a fascination for tables next to Windows) and was mesmerised by the breathtaking view of the city. The music, ambience were perfect for a chilled out evening with a great date(note:my husband).
The lemon iced tea was very good.. Perfect in taste. The staff recommended ' the med platter 'as a great vegetarian option and we decided to try that. The platter had falafel, pita pockets, cheese and spinach filos, and the usual dips. The hummus was great and we were serves a hearty portion if it which made us happy coz it's the dips which usually are heroes of this dish. The babagonoush was great and it had a smokey taste which was really good. The curd and cucumber dip definitely needs improvement. It was runny and tasted like buttermilk! Had no taste and we left most of it. The best part of the ambience was hookah had a separate enclosure and wasn't served inside the main restaurant! Will definitely return to this place for a relaxing evening! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sajid Feroz | 60540 | 1.0 | 2016-09-11 17:20:01 | New place and pathetic service....guy at the reception refused to give a table coz I was alone and suggested a table outside in open when it was so  hot outside.After a while I was a given a table with no seat n ws suggested to stand n eat (brilliant!) Although after some protest a seat was provided.i even noticed couples were asked to share a table even when some of the tables were empty ! It was quite bizzare !! imagine going on a double date with some strangers ! It was like they just wanted to give table to group of 4 or more ,again like I said restaurant was not even full!

Food was served ..I ordered a prawn dish ,peach ice tea and the snicker bar for dessert.prawn dish was good ,the ice tea wasn't served n after 45 minutes of ordering I was told it's not available .the snicker bar was good (recommended) !! Some how all the servers were lost in their own world ,roaming around in groups n hardly paying attention to customers ..that too when there was no rush at all ! 
 
I am not tat critical while writing reviews but m quite surprised how casual the staff was while handling their customers (that too being a new place in town).I have been to monkey bar in Delhi and tat place is amazing ! 

Service - 0/5
Decor -4/5 (lovely view of Victoria memorial n hoogly bridge ) 
Food - 3.5 (would love to explore more) 

Must have - the snicker bar |
 
Monkey Bar | Aadarsh Agarwal | 1183989 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 17:18:45 | The ambience and location of the place was top notch. With the bar not licensed yet the food surely compensated. There is a separate outdoor section for shisha takers. Lastly, the view of Victoria was the cherry on the cake. |
 
Monkey Bar | Reevu Wangdi | 284286 | 5.0 | 2016-09-11 00:42:46 | Great place to chill & dine... best thing is they serve beef...Tiger beef was succulent and spiced to perfection... Korean bulgogi beef rice was flavoursome ... chorizo pork pav was delicious... ampanna done right... and service was tops... gonna be back when the bar opens ..I believe next week it is... good going .. |
 
Monkey Bar | Devanshi Powani | 33090142 | 3.5 | 2016-09-10 23:54:27 | The snicker bar desert and the Aam aadmi eggs were the highlight of our dinner. Can't wait for the bar to start . Loved the service and the ambience. |
 
Monkey Bar | Jashita Ray | 589467 | 4.0 | 2016-09-09 19:52:29 | Had been waiting eagerly for the opening of Monkey Bar and there I was dragging my fiance, paying a visit in the first week itself. However I would say i rather got slightly disappointed. The staff seemed amateur. They were very amiable but highly confused. Firstly it took them over 20-25mins with repetitive reminders to serve us water. And further disappointment was on asking for the drinks menu, they informed us they didn't have license for alcohol. Thus we had to settle for mocktails. The person who took our mocktail order was so confused. He was unsure of the mocktails on offer, we had to specifically cue him with names like green apple or blue lagoon etc. And oh, there was no paper napkins, spoons and forks or sauces kept on the table for us as some had mentioned in previous reviews - we had to ask for them. Probably they don't have them kept in advance in the open air section.
Now the good part - Everything else!
The ambience - Wow. The view of the Victoria Memorial is simply stunning. You can just sit and spend hours adoring your surroundings.
We ordered a teen paan hookah, along with a Virgin Mangaa- Loved it and a Green Apple Soda which was decent, not that great. Next on our list were the Butterflies, Rooster Booster Burger & Chicken 65. The first two were mouthwatering, especially the burger - juicy, filling, yummilicious. And then the cherry on the pie - the dessert - Snicker bar- I genuinely recommend this. Loved the way they serve it and the taste is heavenly.
Overall, had a lovely evening with the MoBar Mojo! Just wished I could give it a 5 star rating. |
 
Monkey Bar | Luna Chatterjee (Madly_Food_Lover) | 1304639 | 4.5 | 2016-09-09 01:36:56 | The Monkey has finally swung east, and that too it's making it's presence felt !! After Mumbai and Delhi now Kolkata hasit own "Monkey Bar". 
To start with It's an amazing property that has a breathtaking view. You can just gaze at Kolkata skyline while sipping some amazing cocktails.
Curated by acclaimed chef Manu Chandra, Monkey Bar's menu boasts of innovative food and drinks. I absolutely loved each and everything that i tasted but some of the items and drinks need spl mention.
Kerala Rice Salad- A salad made with wild red rice, blended with herbs and topped with curd chilli, the dish is indigenous and light.
Med Platter-A dish which is a visual delight in itself apart from being a total amalgamation of fritters and dips.
Tikki of Joy- A perfect dish to satisfy the bong fish craving.
Butterfly Chicken- Chicken blended with herbs placed inside a butterfly shaped shell.
Prawn Pil Pil- Perfectly prepared Prawn served with bread. Simple yet delicious
Laal Maas Phulka Tacos-Rajasthani laal mash intelligently placed inside tacos, a perfect fusion food.
Spare Pork Ribs- This is ansolutely recommended for those pork lovers. The meat is tender and cooked to perfection in barbecue sauce.
The drinks served quenched our thirst perfectly, among them some needs spl mentionlike Manga, Copper Monkey, Pink Punch. 
The desserts are absolutely delightful.Gondhoraj Lemon Tart is sweet, with a bit of tang!! There is Snicker Bar whichbis total bliss.
So with the coming of Monkey Bar i can safely say that gastronomic revolution has indeed hit our City of Joy. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anamitraa/The Gut Filling | 671420 | 4.0 | 2016-09-09 00:46:21 | The City of Joy is witnessing a major change in the gastronomic culture post the technological revolution of smartphones and wireless technology. There has been evolution of the global food and Calcuttans are gradually getting used to it. After many multinational and national pubs coming to Kolkata, it was the turn for Monkey Bar to refresh Kolkata with its gracious presence.

This 3rd September, I was invited to the Pre Launch of the Kolkata Chapter where the #MonkeySwungEast. It was a lovely happy afternoon where all the foodies, bloggers, critics and experts had a gala time with beautiful cocktails, mocktails and great good.

The place is located at the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building in Camac Street. Blessed with a wonderful view, you can see the Victoria Memorial, St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral and Hooghly Bridge altogether. We had to pick up paper pieces with names of cocktails and sit at the assigned table to participate in games and quizzes. It was a lot of fun. Ambience is all classy with the bar and high chair along with couches. I loved the wall art on the gateway to the open air sitting area which is done with Gupi Bagha, Tana Rickshaw and all the nostalgic memoirs of Kolkata.

The food was equally good. There were many cocktails and I, being a teetotaler had the virgin versions of all the drinks. Some of them were great, actually. We had ‚Äì

Kerala Red Rice Salad - Baby spinach, red rice, raw mango, coconut, peanuts and upmensinkai (salted chilli from Karnataka). I generally do not eat chillies, but this one was so good. Loved it a lot.

Mac & Cheese Croquettes ‚Äì Golden fried broccoli and peas along with chilli mayo and salsa. I am a fan of cheese. So the croquettes were really admired.

Med Platter - Falafel, spinach, cheese filo parcels, hummus, smoked baba ganoush, roasted peppers, olives, with pita bread and labneh. The presentation of this platter was really an eye catching one. It was really good.

Smoked Beetroot and Beans Galouti - Melt in mouth vegetarian galouti on saffron laced taftan, onion and mint chutney. This dish too was okay.

Baked Brie ‚Äì Oh! I loved this dish. Brie cheese with filo surrounded by pineapple salsa. The cheese oozing out of the pastry created all the sensation. Loved this dish a lot. Had a huge share of it from my table.

Prawn Pil Pil - Tossed in olive oil with chilli, garlic and parsley. It was served with garlic rubbed toast. This was extremely delicious. Loved the dish a lot specially for its aroma and the garlic breads, specially.

Tikki of Joy - Kolkata inspired Bhetki fish cutlets with kasundi, fennel seed & coriander, served with mint chutney. This is one classic dish which no Calcuttan will ever fail to love. I was no exception.

Tiger Beef - Slices of steak tossed with chilli paste, black beans, galangal, ginger, bean sprouts, lemon, bok choy and peppers. This dish was a bit spicy, not suited to my taste but loved by my fellow foodies at the table.

Butterfly Chicken - Sweet, spicy, crispy bits of chicken tossed with sesame, chilli, honey and peppers; stuffed in our signature butterfly shells. The butterfly shells resembled to a savoury treat from the lands of Andhra Pradesh, popularly known as Phoolbu. This dish was unique, in presentation and taste.

Laal Maas Phulka Tacos ‚Äì Who doesn‚Äôt know about this classical delicacy of Rajasthan? Monkey Bar has successfully fused this Indian beauty along with Mexican Tacos. This twist in the cuisines creates the beauty of the culinary culture and here lies the skill of a chef, who is an artist in this case. Loved this dish for the innovation.

Spare Pork Ribs ‚Äì Trust me, it is the best pork dish I have had till date. The pork was so soft, juicy and tender that it literally melted inside the mouth. It was tossed in a tangy and sweet sauce which was really good. Writing the review after 5-6 days but I still can‚Äôt get over the beauty of the pork ribs.

Gondhoraj Lime Tart ‚Äì This was one unique dessert we have tried there. Lemon curd, torched meringue, lemon & mint gel, pistachio cake & cookie crust ‚Äì combination of all good things at one go. Loved the refreshing vibe of this dessert.

The Snicker Bar ‚Äì I am not a big Snicker fan. But this dessert along with the perfect swirls of the s‚Äômore has become one of the desserts to crave for at the strangest of times. Milk chocolate ganache, dark chocolate micro cake, hazelnut praline cream, salted caramel gel being the composition of this dessert, I loved it till the end.

Drinks ‚Äì Copper Monkey, Manga, Pack of Punch, Toast To Calcutta, Mad Men. I was in Team Copper Monkey. Had the virgin version of all the drinks. Liked the Manga to be the best, which they claim to be one of their signature cocktails along with Copper Monkey, which was also very good.

I would like to thank the nationally acclaimed figure Chef Manu Chandra to spend and share his valuable words about food and Team Monkey Bar for having us over and presenting a lifetime of memories. Best wishes to the team and may they prosper ahead. Happy Dining! :) |
 
Monkey Bar | The Hungry Desis (Ramya & Chiranjeev) | 30569103 | 4.5 | 2016-09-08 16:29:59 | Monkey Bar has finally come to the City of Joy and promises to be a perfect place to have fun and relax. When we walked into the gastropub, the first thing that came to our minds was "classy and quirky".¬†
The best of it all is the stunning view.  You have a clear sight of the St. Paul's Cathedral and the Victoria Memorial in the distance. The service staff are swift and attentive.
 Another thoughtful design is the assortment of condiments and cutlery set on the tables. You can use them as you like instead of calling for the servers everytime. The cocktails are innovative, using a variety of ingredients and the food is lip-smackingly delicious! Our recommendations are the Mangaa and the Tipsy Sherbet among the drinks. With regards to the food, the vegetarian dishes are as good as the non vegetarian ones. We suggest the Med Platter and the Baked Brie among the vegetarian choices. For the non-vegetarians, the Prawn Pil Pil is a must try. To achieve full satiisfaction, do sample the Snicker Bar..it is to die for! |
 
Monkey Bar | Varnika | 380228 | 4.5 | 2016-09-07 10:06:59 | The wait is finally over. The moment you enter Monkey Bar, you get the feel of the one in Bangalore. The open air area is simply amazing, the view of Victoria Memorial is breathtaking. 
I loved the ambience of the inner section as well. Even though it has some basic monkey bar elements missing the place is great overall. 
We ordered the MoBar Classic Chilli Cheese Dragons which were to die for. 
For drinks we had the Copper One which was quite bad. It didn't taste of Alcohol at all. 
Taste of Calcutta was refreshing and nice. Pack a punch was also decent. 
All in all once they start functioning full time and properly it will be a great place. Super excited! |
 
Monkey Bar | Roli Vajpeyi | 909801 | 5.0 | 2016-09-06 23:07:49 | Monkey bar finally opens in Kolkata! You guys are in for a treat the cocktails are so unique and nice you can't just order one! And the snacks are just awesome. This is my new hang out place. The desserts specially the snickers one is just amazing. |

Desi Lane | Poulami Prasad | 16328041 | 4.5 | 2016-12-05 09:58:22 | Just wow!! Yesterday night went 4 a bday party!! Grt ambience food was also good, satisfied service and a very nice place to hangout with friends.. The hookah was served with a bad coal though but they quickly replaced it and the chicken drumsticks was too spicy..  but the dance floor and the ambience was  attractive.. Thanks for a good time! ! |
 
Desi Lane | Vasuki Jasani | 34767270 | 5.0 | 2016-12-01 09:39:59 | We planned on having my parent's 25th wedding anniversary here and it was the best decision we made.
Ambience of this place just justifies its name and every bit of it has a desi touch. It gave a very cozy or rather comfortable feeling.
Drinks served to us were perfectly made and d starters were served absolutely hot.
This place has amazng props to click pictures with and the look of the entrance is gorgeous.....totally a picture taking zone!!!
Most importantly the food was delicious, the dal makhani, punjabi aloo and biryani is a must try here. |

Desi Lane | Mukesh D. Jasani | 36751864 | 5.0 | 2016-11-16 22:24:56 | Had thrown a private party of 40 guests on 12th November for my business associates in the Disc. Complete paisa wasool.....i got so many thank u messages from my friends saying that they never had such rocking party. Great party, great DJ, excellent service, the staffs were there till 2.30 am without a sign of frustration on their faces rather they were so very helpful. One of my friend was little high & puked. I wl never forget the service the manager gave to my friend. 
Thank u Desi Lane....I m really touched |
 
Desi Lane | Micky Gupta | 775896 | 5.0 | 2016-11-16 22:07:08 | Excellent place, great food, great vibes....a must must visit place. Highly recommended for private parties. Never experienced this kind of service anywhere. Desi Lane rocks !! |

Desi Lane | Eshita Surana Poddar | 2310310 | 1.0 | 2016-11-12 23:36:35 | Horrible experience # extremely bad service # order not served properly # undercooked food # on asking for cancellation, immediately excepted # paid deaf hear to problems |
 
Desi Lane | Arnab Datta | 32341647 | 5.0 | 2016-11-11 13:18:11 | If u are looking for a unique restaurant cum bar, then Desi Lane is the place to be... The ambience is simply something one has never experienced in Kolkata before. It is just like a local street with barber shops type themes, movie posters, khatiyas¬†(beds) as sitting places, etc etc... What's more is there's an Autorickshaw and a typical Bajaj scooter inside the place to excite all... The nostalgic movie posters from the golden era of Hindi ¬†cinema, the witty phrases all around will amuse you... It's like a walk down the memory lane of the old times before modernization of India.¬†

Additionally, there are games that one can play like the foosball, darts, spin a wheel, dice etc.

Wide choice of food and drinks with a variety of cocktails and mocktails will surely delight your taste buds. It's a fun place to be for sure and definitely a place one should visit with family and friends alike. Wouldn't like to spoil the fun by saying all that I found interesting there... So do visit this place if you get a chance...¬†One thing is for certain, if anyone visits Desi Lane, he or she is bound to return... for its one place you can never forget.

Keep up the good work Team Desi Lane!!! |

Desi Lane | Swati Bhartia | 31041168 | 2.5 | 2016-11-06 11:41:23 | Good ambience,nice decor,very spacious ,nice food but HORRIBLE service.....waiters hiding themselves when called , busy taking leftover hookah of customers n unability to serve....spoils every good thing about the place..  waiters are not at all trained n proffesional |
 
Desi Lane | Manan Sharma | 36618223 | 5.0 | 2016-11-05 21:13:28 | Superrr se upparrrr. .....super awesome food. Generally we see that restaurants & hotel ppl upload pictures which doesn't match with the actual place...pics r way better then the actual place bcos of photo editing effects but guys in your case it's just the opposite. ...u hv uploaded pics which r not that great whereas the actual place is far better...infact I have not seen such lovely concept & equally great food & service  at one place ...keep up the good work & keep raising the bar |
 
Desi Lane | Vmurarka77 | 1176524 | 3.0 | 2016-10-24 22:34:39 | The place has a mix theme of Bollywood & Village. It's very spacious. Has a couple of private dinning rooms for small parties & a disc. The food is good but nothing to rave about. |
 
Desi Lane | Tanshi Agarwal | 16343188 | 5.0 | 2016-10-21 13:36:07 | Superb Ambience! Delicious and sumptuous Food! Excellent service!!! Awesome music and very innovative props and interiors!! Loved it! Will definitely recommend to all my friends. |
 
Desi Lane | Sohini Sarkar | 33862921 | 3.5 | 2016-10-19 22:51:46 | Bring that color back in your dull looking life with colorful and tasty food in Desi Lane.

Welcoming you from the lanes of Alipore are multitudes of rainbow colored bulbs, old Bollywood posters and even a cute, yellow scooter.

Located on the posh street of Burdwan Road, Alipore, this place falls right after the SBI building.

Prettily decorated place, with spot clean tables, the restaurant cum lounge bar is divided into two settings. While the immediate entrance of the place leads you to their moderately large sized restaurant hall, the hookah lounge is located behind a cushioned closed door.

The lounge room has a large screen TV. They make their shisha good. Hitting the strong flavours are paan salsa, paan rasna while grape is noticeably a mild flavor. 

Their Chili Cheese Toast is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. This maybe a bit of extra enthusiasm for a piece of toast, but it deserves all of it. Crispy base with gooey cheese on top. And that is not all, the flavor is off the roof. A five out of five for this item.

Although this place deserves a five, there are somethings that disappointed me as a customer massively. The service here is bad.

I had ordered cheese sandwich for myself, but our waiter had misunderstood it to be toasts. The toasts as stated earlier were excellent. No complaints regarding that. However, the miscommunication led to a bill that was way too much.

Although it was later taken care of by the staff team, this sort of mistakes really does ruin a customer's experience on a huge scale.

The food here is excellent. So is the decor and the ambiance, hence the 3.5

I'll be coming back here because the food I believe deserves more than what I rated. One of your hidden gems in Alipore. Drop by and be amazed. |
 
Desi Lane | AkritiPoddar | 16125324 | 4.0 | 2016-10-17 14:04:28 | Amazingly themed and offers a great ambience. The quirky posters and the Desi khatiya were well thought of. Could be visited with both family and friends as the place hosts family crowds as well. The Service is very quick and they ensure all guests have a good time.
Do check out the Chinese dishes if you're looking for something spicy and crisp. 
Desi Lane surely lives up to it's name by creating the most suitable environment for Desi lovers. |
 
Desi Lane | Ajay Pandey | 36365984 | 5.0 | 2016-10-15 15:18:49 | One of the best place to be with your family and friends.

What an ambience, service & food. We have been used to ordering Dal Makhani whenever we go to a restaurant...but Desi Lane has made us addicted to their Dal Hariyali....lovely food...must try Fried Ice cream |
 
Desi Lane | Saloni Siotia | 36255423 | 4.5 | 2016-10-07 00:30:36 | The ambiance is really good. The food is also very good. Very happy with the wife variety on the menu.

Desi Lane | Surolia | 898402 | 5.0 | 2016-10-06 15:03:21 | Been to Desi Lane. Had vegetarian food over there without onion and garlic. I can say that no other restaurant can offer such delicious good without onion & garlic.
Hariyali Daal, Desi Videshi mixed veg and Fried Ice Cream are signature dishes which one can relish over there. |
 
Desi Lane | Ankita Patni | 3072545 | 4.5 | 2016-10-04 00:19:09 | One word for desi Lane ' WoW' . everything is so good about the place. Food, staffs , music , ambience , vibes . loved it to the core. Amazing ambience.  You feel so positive and happy here. Nice food. Must visit . |
 
Desi Lane | Swati Singhania | 1793405 | 5.0 | 2016-10-01 19:52:00 | I have been to this few times by now, and every time I step in the place..its always brimming with life. The food here is awesome.  I have tried their North indian food, Chinese and also few of the Italian dishes. All of them very relished by my taste buds.  But the best thing about the restaurant is that it has carved out a space for all. A separate section for family groups and parallely a separate section when you are dining with your friends. 
You can walk into the place and let the balance be taken care by their courteous team. Seems I have found another favorite joint! |
 
Desi Lane | Pritha Dasgupta | 36189124 | 5.0 | 2016-10-01 13:04:34 | full marks to u guys.great ambiance,great food,each and every ppl who worked here very much well-mannered,the hariyali dal was superbly tasty ...awesome blossom food ...keep it up! |
 
Desi Lane | Pamela Nandi | 2821382 | 4.0 | 2016-09-29 21:04:20 | Located on the first floor of the bldg The Enclave at the Alipore StateBank crossing - perfect adda placeto chill out with friends in desi style. Visited one sunday evening - the place is over crowded and noisy. But the highway like¬† theme with roadside low seaters and the bar - Desi Theeka will attract every guest to visit this place again and again. There are private dinning areas for family who would prefer to enjoy food away from the crowd and noise. Nothing new in the menu, but the food was good - butter lemon fish. In terms of service and hospitality, this eatery is a bit messy. Looks like they are still not yet well settled to serve the guests. |
 
Desi Lane | Sweta Agarwal | 36152816 | 5.0 | 2016-09-28 15:00:42 | A newly opened Resto bar in Alipore, the place is a must visit whether you planning a casual dine out with friends, family time over food, Night out with music and drinks or a private party for your group. The theme - totally desi with the right combination of quirkiness, adores the walls and indoors and the food - perfect for every taste and cuisine. Don't forget to get yourself clicked at the photo booth, on the scooter or inside the auto. Options galore, Desi Lane rocks.. |
 
Desi Lane | Dj ArV | 36141303 | 5.0 | 2016-09-28 00:36:40 | I went on a Sunday....it was chocobloc. We had to wait for around 30 odd minutes but it was worth the wait. Full marks to you guys....Great ambiance, great food.....thought service was little slow which is acceptable considering the kind of rush u had. Awesome awesome food ....keep it up !! |

Looks expensive but reasonable enough to plane for a date or a family dinner.
Thumps up for this place! !!!!!!!!!! |
 
Desi Lane | Gaurav Vyas | 31237453 | 5.0 | 2016-09-27 13:51:22 | We had the best Chinese food the other night at desi lane.

Desi Lane | Aakriti | 35147778 | 5.0 | 2016-09-19 14:12:06 | Awesome ambience and good food. This new restaurant houses a lounge, a separate hookah room , a karaoke room and the main floor. Quirky paintings and pictures adorn the walls with a great and colourful entry giving you the ultimate North Indian feel. They did a good job with the food as well. A must try |
 
Desi Lane | Deepshikha Saraf | 258224 | 2.5 | 2016-09-18 18:18:42 | The restaurant opened right next to my place. Had been planning to visit for a long while, ever since the soft launch. 
The ambience is okay. Desi lane doesn't match with the feel. The old posters is the only design feel. The chairs are so high! Almost like a bar. And the sofa are so low. The distance between the table and the sofa is so much that u have to shift aage and bend over to eat!!! 

The food is a major let down. We were two of us. So we order cheese kurkure kebab as starters- it was  bland. The roti covering was to thick. And the filling was bland. All u could taste was cheese. No seasoning, nothing. 

Then we ordered for a hariyali sabji moti and a lachcha paratha. The sabji was horrible 
üôàüôàüôà semi raw veggies, bland taste. 

The roti though was crisp and thin. |
 
Desi Lane | Avantika Agarwal | 35835337 | 4.5 | 2016-09-16 11:32:11 | Desi Lane offers an ultimate desi experience, With delicious food and desi decor, it is definitely worth a try. To add to it, It has a very convenient location.¬†

This desi restaurant is every foodie's delight and it offers a large variety of cuisines. ¬†The ambience is very desi and different¬†with khatiyas and autos. We ordered crackling spinach, spaghetti¬†nepolitan,¬† risotto and pizza which tasted very good. We also ordered hookah which was very smooth. ¬†

The staff was very friendly. I strongly recommend this place. |
 
Desi Lane | Ankita Sharma | 35907184 | 5.0 | 2016-09-16 11:26:02 | It is one of my favourites in Kolkata.

Desi Lane | Amit Ruia | 27608956 | 1.0 | 2016-09-15 13:40:33 | Went there this saturday 10/09/16 the service was poor, we ordered two starters in which one was partly left uncooked still they did not give much heed to it as they waiters were more busy with party in inside hall hence we paid the bill and went to red lounge third floor |
 
Desi Lane | Neel Kankani | 35968237 | 4.5 | 2016-09-13 21:20:56 | Excellent food and wonderful ambience . Nice service . Food quality and quantity both are good . Tried plenty of starters and all the items were good |
 
Desi Lane | Kanishk Toshniwal | 1125210 | 5.0 | 2016-09-13 13:01:14 | Yet another amazingly themed restaurant.. The Desi Lane . Themed with the desi lanes of India . The Bollywood posters .. The truck paintings .. The khatiyas. Raju communications.. It was a different experience for me . The food is good . The quantity is also very good the service was also very quick . The Sultani paneer tikka was superb .. Give a try to the dal makhni.

Desi Lane | Sneha Bhowmick | 35906810 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 17:26:54 | Newly opened with outstanding ambience and DJ on the dance floor. The food was also really great. The main sitting area houses some cool ‚ÄòCharpai‚Äô, as one may see on the roadside Dhabas. The Charpai section has been divided into separate halves, with each of these halves, displaying a unique theme of its own.¬† However it's worth a visit. |
 
Desi Lane | Sumita Chatterjee | 35949403 | 5.0 | 2016-09-12 13:33:34 | Mind blowing ambiance, huge huge place...not seen such big a place in kolkata atleast. Courteous staff , great food, equally good hookah. Keep it up guys...didn't  expect such excellent food & service ...pricing also quiet decent. Only one suggestion...increase the food portion of the veg platter. |
 
Desi Lane | Hari Sharma | 35949145 | 5.0 | 2016-09-12 13:06:42 | Went on a Sunday. It was chocobloc. Still preferred to wait for almost 35 - 40 mins. Have no idea how almost 40 minutes passed. I Was just looking at the amazing interiors & my wife & son were busy taking selfies. So courteous staffs that even after being over occupied due to heavy rush they served us water & offered a fresh lime to my son free of cost...100 rupee worth of free fresh lime is not a big deal but its difficult to see this kind of a personal touch & respect for guests ...most restaurants don't even allow to stand in the restaurant area when they are full.  Food quality was equaly good & worth the wait. As far as the food quality is concerned would rate it amont the top 3 in kolkata. Will recommend a must must visit for this place. Completely in love with this place. |
 
Desi Lane | Rajni Agarwal Gupta | 31655966 | 1.0 | 2016-09-12 00:23:03 | One of d worst place i have visited in recent times, pathetic service,pathetic people....i visited on a Sunday and i knw d fact tht i might hv to wait, but hete no one is thr to guide u as to whn can u get a table,after repeated attempts they did give us a table without cleaning and we had to repeatedly ask them to clean up after which they obliged....no water giving nothing fr which again we had to ask n thn icing on d cake was water falling frm AC vent on d table ws r seated n whn d waiter said to d manager he was so damn cool abt it n his reply was tht " haan pata hai pani girta hai,ruko change kar denge table" ...this was enough test of our patience n we decided to leave thn n thr without hvng nythng n ths was d kind of service they r providing after 10.30 p.m.which is not tht peak timing.Sorry bt i wud request d readers to just think twice bfore visiting d place coz at d end its nt only bt d ambience,its all avout service u provide to d customers. |
 
Desi Lane | Megha | 1936800 | 1.0 | 2016-09-11 20:12:58 | Placed an order for a chicken steak and a chicken tikka masala kabab for home delivery. After 20 mins of placing the order I got a call from them saying that the steak was not available. I went ahead with the kabab order. 
The kabab was absolutely chewy and unedible!! The mint chutney served with it was watery. I don't think that I would want to order again. Paid 450 bucks for this. What a waste of money!!! |
 
Desi Lane | Harsh Borar | 309524 | 4.0 | 2016-09-07 17:32:05 | Great Food. Great Location. Massive space. They have separate dining sections for groups, a decent sized lounge.
The only problem I found was the noise coming from the lounge everytime the door opens , that's too loud for the people sitting inside. |
 
Desi Lane | Nikunj Agarwal | 309164 | 5.0 | 2016-09-04 00:08:49 | We were a group of 20 and we took a private area of the venue. Each and every guest in our group enjoyed the venue, the ambience, the fact that we were in a private area which felt like a private home longe where we could unwind the way we want. The food was awesome, the energy of the team of Desi lane was such that they were eager to give us a great experience. Loved every moment. Thank you desi lane for making our evening memorable. |
 
Desi Lane | Hamzaa Mohammed | 27460420 | 4.0 | 2016-09-02 15:37:14 | Love the food here. Totally worth it. Desi lane is very different from other North Indian joints in the city. For its amazing hookah and quirky interiors, it's definitely worth a visit. |
 
Desi Lane | Manisha Sharma | 35396500 | 5.0 | 2016-08-26 09:53:59 | I hv visited this place last night with my family. Amazing food , specially Indian cuisine and great hospitality. Ambiance is superb, every corner is different, entertainment full on .Best place to go. |
 
Desi Lane | Yamini Kedia Jhunjhunwala | 2455586 | 2.0 | 2016-08-25 17:43:19 | Horrible food . Just one word .. Horrible .. Good ambience .. Hooka was choking . Kali Dal was so sweet . Veg manchurian was over fried and smelly . It has nothing to do with discount as it hardly matters . |
 
Desi Lane | Juhi Ramakant | 34669926 | 1.0 | 2016-08-20 17:26:51 | First of all its got no signage at ground level making it tough to locate
when you reach the first floor, it looks like under construction because of the outside
seating is not really comfortable and the place is too too bright that it hurts the eye
the food is below average and there is a massive room for improvment
the service is quick which is the only thing i liked about the place |
 
Desi Lane | Sudipta Majumdar | 843646 | 4.5 | 2016-08-19 22:08:23 | Curious me dropped in Desi Lane on the very first week of its opening and I was clearly bowled out by the vibrant ambience.Located in plush Alipore, this themed den can be best described as a place that encourages one to unwind with good friends. This week I returned to celebrate my birthday with a whole bunch of pals, and my guests had a rolling time. The in-house Dj sure knows how to keep you on the dance floor. The selfie wall is to die for, and the food was just the perfect accompaniment. Having our slurp of tom kha gai or the lip-smacking Desi Lane special meatballs would be remembered for long. A space buzzing with desi vibes, the place surely created a whole new experience for us friends.  Thank you Desi Lane for making my birthday celebration an affair to cherish. |
 
Desi Lane | Sbalaji82 | 15744691 | 5.0 | 2016-08-07 18:17:06 | On a recent trip to Kolkata, a friend of mine took us along to this new restaurant "DESI LANE"..initially i was skeptical to have a get together in a untested restaurant..but the moment it stepped in my thoughts changed and i got carried away into the ambiance..Food was fantastic and economical..the staff were also very cooperative..music too was good..end to end a good place to enjoy and let yourself loose..seems like the place is calling me back with Sir Rabindranath Tagores famous patriotic song "Jodi Tor Dak Shune Keu Na Ase Tobe Ekla Cholo Re....... (calling me to comeback even alone to this place...)" ..Thanks for bringing this in such a beautiful city |

Desi Lane | Subhrajit Pramanick | 35464832 | 4.5 | 2016-08-01 23:51:56 | This place was in my mind to for quite some time and finally when I decided to visit it was one good decision. The ambiance is superb and the place is amazing in so many ways. This place really took me on a nostalgic trip with its interiors. Food and Drinks: Well, this part was really amazing. Starters were a lovely affair. I started off with
with ‚ÄúShajani Murgh Bahar‚Äù and my veggie friend‚Äôs favorite ‚ÄúGolden Baby corn with Spinach Sauce‚Äù both was delicious! 
The main course was the next best thing to arrive on our table. 
Mutton Rara Ghost .. you should not miss this one , its best in the town . Mutton is soft to the core with one Kabli Naan . On the other hand my friend was moved with ‚Äú Benarashi Dum alu and ‚Äú Lacheder paratha..

Coming to the desserts, we ordered ‚ÄúMalpuya with Rabri . never tried this combination but definitely would have missed if not tried .

Service:The service here is superb. The staff is courteous and is always on their toes to assist you with everything. They serve with smile and I am definitely coming back here :) |

Monkey Bar | 18361667 | (22.544307, 88.352079) | https://www.zomato.com/kolkata/monkey-bar-camac-street-area | ['American', 'Asian', 'European', 'North Indian'] | 


Monkey Bar | Sirsha Dhar | 2015246 | 4.5 | 2016-12-15 21:54:11 | My friend, who was leaving the city soon wanted to go out for food and drinks and what could have been better than our decision to hit the Monkey Bar. Finally opened in Kolkata, one of the best-located bar there possibly is. On the 9th floor of Fort Knox on Camac Street, this looks down the beautiful Kolkata skyline with the 2nd bridge, Victoria, St. Pauls church and what not. The place is huge, quaintly decorated with the essential Bong touch both in the menu and the bar. Has an open area with a huge screen. 
For food we ordered the Mobar Caramelised Pork Ribs. Melt in the mouth pork meat. Smoked Chicken, Chicken Salami and Harissa pizza. For drinks we took the Beamer LIIT. Just the right punch of alcohol and tang! Lovely experience. Would definitely like to go back again. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohan Belani | 3081061 | 3.5 | 2016-12-15 02:58:39 | The place has a chill vibe . Went with a few school buddies.  There is a open air section as well as an indoor section where you can sit and chill . Drinks were nice . Service could be better . The staff were not attentive enough . Lastly the music . There were people singing karaoke. I mean it's cool to sing and all but we expected some chill music with the setting . |
 
Monkey Bar | Pratik Shah | 31614924 | 3.0 | 2016-12-14 13:50:20 | With an indoor and outdoor seating options and great ambience "monkey bar" is sure to impress you . I didnt order much to eat , bt watever i ordered was average - 
Yes it is lil on the expensive side - overall good place to chill once in a while . |
 
Monkey Bar | Shruti Bhaiya | 593379 | 4.0 | 2016-12-11 17:47:13 | A must go places for the party peeps in kolkata.  Good food , good music and an awesome ambience. .  A complete thumbs up .. the only thumbs down would be the quantity  of the food served , it's too little and gives u just a taste of the dish !! |
 
Monkey Bar | Avinaba Das Sarkar | 409341 | 3.0 | 2016-12-11 11:02:59 | Went yesterday with a business partner, wasn't really very particular about a place but since it was located near by thought of visiting it once. Few observations

1. The ambiance is nice and the interiors are pretty well done.

2. Music is pretty loud and if you are intending to have a prolonged conversation with someone it would be difficult. 

3. The biggest drawback is the food, we ordered two veg starters since my friend was veg. The quantity and the taste wasn't something justifying the price or the brand. The food was OK but it isn't something one will find difficult to prepare in there kitchen. 

Overall experience was okay since we primarily went there to seat and talk. But comparing the same with the likes to cafe mezzuna or the grid would make this place average at the best. Hope the management looks into it. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rishi Agarwal | 1632482 | 4.5 | 2016-12-10 17:02:43 | On the 9th floor at Fort Knox, the newly opened Monkey Bar is a beautiful place to visit. The place offers an unmatched view of the city and the interiors and a class apart which make it one step ahead of other places in the city.
The food on offer is delicious. The mushrooms I ordered and the chilli cheese dragons are a must try for all.
Overall a great new place to visit with a great atmosphere and very polite attendants. |
 
Monkey Bar | TraveKings | 29893242 | 4.5 | 2016-12-07 13:14:55 | Located at Fort Knox. It is like Social in Delhi. Good Ambience. Maintaining a Good Standard. Decent Crowd. Decent Hookah & Decent Food. Good Service.¬†2 big screen to enjoy live sports .¬†Little expensive. It will cost around Rs.3000 for 2 person.A Good place to hangout with friends. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sukanya Ghosh | 589490 | 3.5 | 2016-12-04 21:24:11 | This one is new in Kolkata, and is definitely pulling lot of crowd. I went there on a Friday evening with two of my friends and it was full of people. Located in camac street, near Urban Desi, not too difficult to locate. The moment you step in , the first thing you notice are the big french windows with a view to die for :), Howrah Bridge and Victoria Memorial at the same, who would not love that!¬†
Now coming to the food, its nothing extraordinary, very mediocre tasting with prices on the higher side. We ordered for 1 mix mushroom bruschetta, mushroom and truffle oil pizza, and tikki of joy (fish). The bruschetta and the pizza was very ordinary, bland in taste I would say. Tikki of joy was definitely good with very subtle flavours, perfectly cooked to perfection.
My rating is truly for the ambience and the fish, anyway one could always try out this place¬†
Thumbs up for the view :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Gunjan Saraf | 33964908 | 4.5 | 2016-12-03 14:49:16 | My visit to this place raised my bar of expectations from kolkatas nightlife.. Posh crowd, sophisticated ambience, soothing music, projector screen for matches, good food and superb hukka! The place has it all. We ordered for lebanese platter and cheese spring rolls, both finger licking good! The capuccino cofee was average but the hukka made up for it! A must visit for all the crazy kolkatans looking for a break from chai break! |
 
Monkey Bar | Subham Agarwal | 777244 | 1.0 | 2016-12-01 13:05:10 | THIS PLACE IS PATHETIC

I ATE THE PANEER KHICHDI AND I AND MY FRIEND BOTH ¬†HAD A TERRIBLE INFECTION AFTER HAVING THIS. I THINK THEIR COOKING STANDARDS ARE VERY LOW.

WHEN I CALLED THEM TO SAY THAT I HAD A TERRIBLE INFECTION AFTER HAVING YOUR FOOD THEY ¬†HAD NO ANSWER.

I HAVE ALSO PUT UP A COMPLAIN AT FOOD AND QUALITY STANDARDS DEPARTMENT AGAINST THEM,

I SUGGEST NO ONE SHOULD GO THERE AT ALL. |
 
Monkey Bar | Risshe Malhotra | 31063007 | 4.5 | 2016-11-29 22:39:12 | Amazing food lovely ambience, joy is one of the best ppl he makes you feel special and the service is out of the world. Centrally located... |
 
Monkey Bar | Reetuparna Dutta | 1190721 | 4.5 | 2016-11-28 17:24:05 | Great place good food and good atmosphere. Loved the drinks as well ordered the manga with absolut and hot wings and loaded nachos with chicken . Everything was top notch. |
 
Monkey Bar | Kirti Agarwal | 16014301 | 3.0 | 2016-11-28 15:30:12 | I think it is one of the over rated places..the service was ok..music was very sad n sheesha not dat great...although ambience was good..but such a brand it is..der is an expectation bar which it disappoints to a great extent. |
 
Monkey Bar | Amrita Ghosh | 33949647 | 4.0 | 2016-11-26 20:51:37 | Want to dine with a view of Victoria memorial, step in here, which interiors n amazing food, gud classics as music and a lovely crowd, one cn spend hours here dining n wining. Food: chicken nachos is a good quantity. Mediterranean platter a lovly combo of flavors n great taste. Pizzas are thin crust n perfect. Drinks are innovative, I tried mamas girl & mojitos. Its one a litl higher side on the pocket but not exorbitant. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sanjiv Sood | 186102 | 4.5 | 2016-11-26 07:39:01 | The ‚ÄòMonkey Bar‚Äô Kolkata Avatar is a welcome addition to it's watering hole map and what an experience it metes out! Located in the heart of the city (Camac Street) with a huge and lofty space, it exudes a comfort zone feel. The visual delight of the interior space couples well with a spectacular view of the Kolkata skyline from the restaurant.¬†

The cream de la cr√®me among the restaurant‚Äôs USP's is the outdoor seating arrangement of about 5-6 tables. Although open to air, yet it is air-conditioned to beat the muggier months. Incidentally during the clement months it would be a pronounced experience to soak in Kolkata‚Äôs mild winters. The corner verandah serves hookah for the y-generation and for those who love to smoke with their tipple it is a rather comfortable space. I loved the incipient November chill all through the evening in the outdoor! It would be an idyllic place all through the wintery months to soak in the chilled weather.

Though I am not a cocktail loving person, I ventured out to try some of their swinging concoctions. First shot was the famed Manga.

Sweet and Tangy Vodka based cocktail, it had an all desi flavour burst from the Aam Panna as the main base with its signature cumin flavour to follow. It comes in a kullar shaped glass with etched in a typical Hinglish font that sets the tone for a fusion evening. 
Next, was the more stylized ‚ÄòMad Men‚Äô a Bourbon base with Coffee Orange and a whiff of Rosemary spray, which, I really liked and got myself a double dose.

 
 

Getting headier, I tried out the Copper Monkey, lo and behold but predictably it was in a copper mug. I quite liked the passion fruit flavour and the hint of mint in it worked well.

¬†

Although christened as ‚ÄòMonkey Bar‚Äô one would be rather surprised to see a super array of fusion food alongwith some very innovative desi leaning twisters. One look at the menu and I was instantly attracted to the Laal Maas Phulka Tacos, Radish cake bites for its novelty, Mobar Caramelized Pork ribs for its slow cooking and the Butterfly Chicken for the signature shells. 
The Laal Maas in the Phulka Tacos was juicy and well done, served on a ¬†Bao Stand for appeal as well as to function as a 'hold on'.  The meat was unique in flavour and spiced up enough to support its Laal Maas Status! 

 

The radish /mooli cake bites were indeed a experience though one really cannot make out if radish is used as the main filling ingredient unless told. The Tempura batter and the black bean sauce make up for the frunchy bite and flavour of the Radish bites.

 

The caramelized rib was succulent and smokey, living up the 6-hour slow cooked traditional method. So was it's house sauce quite zesty and lip smacking. 

 

The Butterfly Chicken was perhaps the only dish, which I would give the pass, though a visual delight again. I was lead to believe or was expecting a Butter Chicken filling. Maybe that is a good idea too.

Overall this place is not all just ambience, though that feeling is certainly overwhelming and sets up the mood. The service, food and the liquid chemistry in the cocktails are commendable too.

Monkey Bar | Kaustav Nayak | 1276373 | 5.0 | 2016-11-25 09:43:48 | With its French windows giving a glimpse of both the Victoria Memorial as well as the Howrah Bridge, the ambient lighting, great music, brick walls, a gorgeous skylight, a section that projects black and white motion picture and an apparently messy but ultimately symmetric seating arrangement that will please the OCD in you, Monkey Bar is hands down the best looking place in town. The ambiance, crowd and the location itself (9th floor of the Fort Knox building in Camac Street) itself demands a high rating. But it outdoes itself in the food department as well.¬†

The tiger beef is an instant classic. Perfectly cooked and just the right amount oily, this is a dish that I will highly recommend. The chettinad chicken samosas on the other hand flattered to deceive, definitely not worth the high price. Reddy's chicken popcorn though is a whole different story : small pieces of chicken fried with curry leaves, ¬†sesame, coconut shreds and a concoction of south Indian spices.¬†The name that will pique your interest however is the butter chicken khichudi. Bengali style sticky rice cooked amalgamated with Punjabi style chicken butter masala, this is a dish that has sharp flavors very well attuned for the Indian tongue. I absolutely loved it! 4 small cups containing curd, ghee, pickle and papad are given as accompaniments.¬†
¬†

And just everything else, their dessert section is more than competent too. While the snicker bar with its milk chocolate ganache on a crunchy almond base and a chocolate cake below may feel a tad too sweet, they provide a coffee ice cream to go with it and together the balance is delectable. The gondhoraj lime tart was more in my wheelhouse : the tangy lime curd really stood out. If I have to recommend one among these two I'd say take a leap of faith, ditch the always reliable chocolate and go for the tart.¬†

Here's to next time. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pratik Sensarma | 10848301 | 5.0 | 2016-11-22 20:50:17 | A too good place to b with your friends...had been there some days before...services are good...and ambience... Wat a place... After a long time had been to such an awesome place like this... One could have a marvelous view of the city Kolkata... Specially our Victoria memorial and cathedral Church...the foods are very tasty ...starting from Manga , tiger beef, tikki of joye to other cocktails  everything was perfectly made and served. Then lastly the desserts...the chocolate cake mainly... Was the best... Really had an too good time..keep it up guys  :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Anusreea Paul | 2257306 | 4.5 | 2016-11-21 12:13:39 | The famous brand is finally here in Kolkata. It's been three months since they opened doors on Camac Street and there's been no looking back for them :)
Had the opportunity to visit the place thanks to a bloggers meet. This is the brain child of chef Manu Chandra, the team, the food is crafted by him. The place epitomizes awesomeness in every inch. The place is big, read huge!! The huge old school windows lead you to stare at the city landscape with wide open eyes. They have an open seating arena, high rise chairs and comfortable sofas to choose from. They serve alcohol and hookah. They even arrange for sundowners on wintry afternoons, for you to sip on their lavish cocktails and enjoy the sun going down. The Victoria Memorial and the Howrah bridge are visual delights. They have their pub rules hence it is better to read them up and visit!
The crafted menu for the afternoon:

**Drinks**

Copper Monkey: Served in a copper vessel with a ¬†chunk of orange came this cocktail, whiskey based.

Manga: The ever famous drink, vodka based, a concoct of vodka and mango pulp.

Hipster Smash: Smacking name, and a refreshing drink! The array of colors are incredible. Mix of watermelon juice, a huge chunk of frozen watermelon and vodka.

Old Fashioned on Camac: The name might sound synonymous with rum but it is a whiskey based cocktail.

**Food**

Kerala Red Rice: A vegetarian and a non-vegetarians' delight! Thick red rice mixed with southern spices. It's spicy, it's crunchy, and it's tangy!!

Tiger Beef: The best, best, best beef is served here!! A bowlful of spicy meaty delight!! The shredded, well cooked, perfectly spiced beef served as the best chakna with the cocktails. Quite filling, good in quantity. Must order and highly recommended.

Butterfly Chicken: The outer coatings are designed like butterflies. Fried to perfection, oil less, the butterfly winged shaped cups are visual delights. Filled inside the cups are shredded chicken mixed in a nice sauce. Recommended for the sheer taste, intensity of the dish, and the efforts behind the perfect butterfly wings!

Shammi Sliders: These little burgers are lovely to look at. They do not fill you up completely yet leave you quite satisfied. The minced meat patties are perfect and there's no saucy drips. You actually do not mess yourself up eating this. Accompanied with some house special fries served inside a cute monkey bar wrapper.

Tikki of Joy: Quite a big hit down south, they decided to include it in their Kolkata menu as well. Huge chunks of bhetki frie to perfection. Served with onion rings and mint chutney. Crispy, ample fish in every mouthful, not oily at all.

Lal Maas Phulka Tacos: even sized parathas half rolled like rolls, filled with minced juicy meat. The meat is tender and you would feel like you are eating a roll, Kolkata style!!

**Desserts**

Gondhoraj Lime Tart: Tad a bit too bitter if eaten without the entire chunk. The idea is take a bit of the biscuit base, the creme, the lemon curd, the pistachio cake, and the raspberry sugared petals. And you could keep eating that and stare into the dreamy wintry sky line. But make sure to get a window seat..:)

Old Monkey Signature Chocolate Cake: What is a chocolate if it does not make you high!!! Well, this one sure does...a huge chunk of chocolate bar sprinkled with praline and caramel sauce. Served with a little scoop of ice cream...aaahhh never felt better!!¬†

Guys, agar aap Monkey Bar nahi gaye to please jaldi jaiye...it's waiting for you!! The coolest place in town to rock and roll. Try their karaoke nights or their usual dining hours, you will not be disappointing!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Suruchi Bhawsinghka | 1140387 | 3.0 | 2016-11-21 09:59:22 | The amount of tax,service charge vat, and wat not they are adding is insane.I have been to so many resto ,trust me this place is not worth it.I would rather sit in a five-star hotel lounge to spend around 5k between 4 ppl. If you leave aside the taxes you would always want to visit this place .Loved d simple decor(specially the huge windows ) perfect place to chill with friends and enjoy your drink.Snacks are average .Guys pls check ur taxes ...u r being unreasonable !!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Prarthana Roy | 1683183 | 3.5 | 2016-11-20 21:42:56 | Firstly , very much overpriced ! But fell in love with their decor and view .. food is overpriced according to their portion and most importantly they don't taste sound to be priced that much ! And coming to tax .. 1000 bucks ?! U will surely be left with a whole in ur pocket .. recommended for once , strictly ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Silpa Chattopadhyay | 34373588 | 5.0 | 2016-11-14 18:17:33 | Luv d this place....gud ambi ...v gud music...nice food.....n quiet disiplined as well i must say....everyone gets a place to sit n r attended well by the staff...i hv been to a no.

Monkey Bar | Dhawal Pratap SIngh | 442772 | 3.5 | 2016-11-14 14:34:01 | The place has excellent ambience and definitely scores well on the food quality. However, the portions are really small adding on to the already heavy cost. Instead of 1500 for 2, its a place where you will incur Rs1500 per person. Plus the taxes are a lot on the pocket. Our regular bill of Rs 4800 had Rs2000 worth of taxes amounting to a total of Rs 6800! Paying 40% tax on top of my bill is not something I was looking forward to. |
 
Monkey Bar | Supriya Baid | 34842096 | 5.0 | 2016-11-13 20:55:15 | One of the best ambience i have ever seem in kolkata! Fabulous üëå great crowd. Good servers. Well maintained. Lovely presentation of food. Hookah love üíï keep it up guys ‚úå |
 
Monkey Bar | Shruti Keshri | 12428511 | 1.0 | 2016-11-08 22:26:50 | Pathetic place, the food quantity is so less, waiters don't understand anything, once you order the order only comes when you die hungry. We waited for  bill for almost 14 mins and then left, the waiter came running out to get the bill, and top of that the bill was wrong, they charged us for we didn't order also.

Over priced, lazy, pathetic place. Never visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | The Calcutta Foodie | 36569739 | 4.5 | 2016-11-08 11:14:50 | Monkey bar is the newest attraction in town and rightly so, talking about interiors the biggest hit is the huge Windows showing the skyline of Calcutta, it's a breathtaking view from the 9th floor. 

The menu is quite innovative and the concoctions in terms of the cocktails are pretty darn good.

The food doesn't disappoint at all the butterfly chicken was crispy and juicy which is very rare a combination and the pork ribs had a smokey barbecue flavour to them and were very, very soft. 

The place is slightly expensive, but, with that ambience and quality, it's hardly an issue. |
 
Monkey Bar | Ms_WalkingShoes | 1193155 | 4.5 | 2016-11-07 18:24:29 | Read d reviews on Zomato n planned to pop over to dis place.
The interiors..ambience...music..crowd n d staff is absolutely perfect.
The view is jus mindblowing n d breeze is so soothing.
We ordered Prawn Pil Pil which was yum..
The Beef Pickle and the Pork Sausages were a bit disappointing.
We had two beers and a virgin mojito.
D thing dat was bit disappointing was dat our bill was 2368Rs...out of which 535Rs was jus all kinda tax.
Overall this place is one of d best plc to hangout around. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rishav Dey | 193398 | 4.0 | 2016-11-07 14:01:53 | Six of us landed up at Monkey Bar on a Saturday evening. It was a nightlife hotspot at 19:30 hours already and we had to wait almost 40 minutes before we could be seated. We were ushered in and given the offer of crowding around the bar which we accepted.
The ambiance was great. Music was good and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Making a conversation wasn't the easiest thing to do but at places like this that is quite expected. 
We kicked off the evening with a portion of Loaded Nachos, 4 helpings of Pack a Punch, one Old Fashioned on Camac with bourbon and one Mama's Girl with Absolut. The last two we had to settle for because Toast to Calcutta couldn't me made due to lack of availability of gin. The nachos were appetizing and I liked my old fashioned with bourbon but the accompanying almond biscotti was too sweet for me. The pack a punch was good but the Mama's Girl was not appreciated by any one.
The Aam Admi Eggs went down well with me. It reminded me of the bhel puri walas and their chutneys. The eggs were soft but firm. It made me crave a bit for the soft, gooey and runny yolk. The Hispter Smash was nice but the Tipsy Sherbet was quite interesting for me because I have always wondered how alcohol would blend with rose syrup and Mo Bar did a wonderful job. The Copper Monkey was a bit like a fruity mint julep but I did like it. The Not so Vanilla was not quite my kind of cocktail with the creamy texture so I exchanged that for the Hipster Smash with a friend. The best cocktail according to me was by far the Mad Men. All the flavours combined really well and complimented each other beautifully. Coffee and orange always work well but the subtle rosemary was a delightful addition. 
The duck pita pockets were great. Oriental flavours in between a pita was an unusual combination but the pita seemed to go quite well with the duck in five spice and the hoisin sauce. The Kerala Beef Fry was nice but I would have loved to have it with Malabar parotta instead of the bread they served. The smoked chicken pizza was decent too. 
The service was very good. There was a period in between when we were very unhappy with the excruciatingly slow service but our server was extremely apologetic about it and cited the reason of a busy weekend evening for the barmen. It was understandable as far as I was concerned. The value for money is perhaps a bit on the lower side and I would say Mo Bar is a moderately expensive place. The food was mostly good. The drinks too were mostly very good. And I couldn't get enough of the Mad Men. So I will return for the Mad Men and to try the beef bulgogi, tiger beef, Goan chrizo pav, baked brie and prawn ghee roast. Recommended if one doesn't mind spending a bit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sharan Bansal | 394157 | 5.0 | 2016-11-06 18:14:14 | Amazing new York style ambience in Kolkata. Great hospitality and service! We had an awesome Sunday lunch with friends over champagne , rum punch and beer ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sahil Islam | 1001945 | 5.0 | 2016-11-05 00:53:16 | Lovely place with nice decor ...... The pricing was excellent given the quality of the food even for non drinkers it is a not to be missed spot loved the duck pita pocket and snicker bar |
 
Monkey Bar | Harsh Agarwal | 615445 | 4.5 | 2016-11-03 22:40:49 | Food, decor and ambience is top notch. Kolkata has got a Gem restaurant and bar. The view and seating is made for each other.

For the egg lovers-"Aam aadmi eggs. Sheer brilliant dish. Must try if you visit.

The staff needs to be a little polite and polished. Lack hospitality and softness. If they can improve upon this, it will be no doubt the finest joint in the city.

Will surely visit again. |
 
Monkey Bar | Santanu Adhikary | 31601287 | 4.5 | 2016-11-02 15:01:09 | Awesome ambience. ..mesmerising view of our beloved quintessential kolkata. ..love the taste of butterfly chicken and nachos with whisky. .. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul | 20537314 | 4.0 | 2016-10-31 13:45:15 | Great food, smooth shisha and pleasant staff at a great location. The food served was fresh and tasty. Though the open area for shisha is a little congested. This is a perfect alternative to bar exchange since the staff is very pleasant. Had an outing with 8 of team mates on October 25, costed 7.5 k excluding alcohol. Will be my preferred location for after work outings as long as the staff is pleasant. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pooja Marwaha | 1981882 | 4.0 | 2016-10-30 23:11:30 | One of the new places opened in Calcutta. This place has a great view of the city with good music. When I say good music, I mean music in the background and you can hear the person sitting opposite to you. The service is spot on. The servers attend to you first and do not chit chat in a corner. Now the food, ordered a farmers pizza which was good enough for an evening snack. The best thing that happened during the evening was the hookah. It was so smooth yet gave the kick. After a very long had really good hookah. The price pinch is moderate too. Would definitely visit more often now. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Agrawal | 1902980 | 4.5 | 2016-10-30 00:43:02 | Since its opening, have been there couple of times already. The evening view of the city is definitely one of the the ups of the place.¬†
The ambience is awesome and the right kind of classy touch interiors makes you want to come n relax with friends.¬†
The mocktails were good, and some dishes mentioning special mention are Chilli Cheese dragons, Med platter, Falafel Sliders and Mobar Laksa.¬†
Thanks Avantika for bringing the Monkey to town. :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Divya Khettry | 1930204 | 4.0 | 2016-10-29 12:09:30 | Finally the Monkey swings East! Must day amazing ambience and view. Drinks were great too the only thing I didn't like here was the food its a little average. I also loved the music all my fav tracks were played. |
 
Monkey Bar | Tushar Goyal | 1881622 | 4.5 | 2016-10-29 10:47:35 | Unluckily I ended up to the place on a Thursday and it was a dry day there, but the food was phenomenal . The moment you see the menu you want to try everything .

We ordered loaded nacho was very good , beet and orange salad which was ok , kimchi baby potatoes is a must try.
For the mains I ordered paneer kichdi which was good and the soulful bowl chilly paneer was good too. 

Going to go again for the non- veg very soon . |
 
Monkey Bar | Komal Agarwal | 34017613 | 3.5 | 2016-10-27 19:38:37 | The only good part about this place was the ambience and picturesque settings. Food is nothing worth mentioning. The spaghetti pasta was bad. Spring rolls & nachos were okay. Among the drinks, I really liked the Virgin Mangaa. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pragya | 1712349 | 3.0 | 2016-10-26 16:50:18 | Ambience - Good

Monkey Bar | Chandramouli Daga | 15803042 | 4.0 | 2016-10-24 20:41:36 | A sensational space with a terrific view of the Calcutta skyline. While it is expensive and the cocktails might not cater to everyone, the food is experimantally delicious while the service is admirable. 

Happening! And how! |
 
Monkey Bar | Moumita Das Talukdar | 343640 | 4.0 | 2016-10-24 20:01:03 | Visited this place at Fort Knox building 9th floor- the new outlet to party with friends. Gorgeous interiors and a stellar reputation as a chain we went there with high expectations and we were satisfied.Spectacular view with good music and awsum food. Innovative cocktails , lipsmacking pork and beef dishes.A must try joint. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anurag Jaiswal | 1778047 | 4.5 | 2016-10-24 18:14:19 | Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox building. The food & service are excellent. Ambiance is awesome. Per pax-Rs.1000 with drinks (inclusive of taxes) |
 
Monkey Bar | Sanjay Bhowmik | 29528004 | 4.0 | 2016-10-23 23:36:21 | I think I would rate this place 95% purely for the ambience and the view....the truly quintessential bar and cafe where you can have an awesome conversation at an awesome side table with an awesome view of the metropolis named Kolkata that I am yet to see anywhere in this city....truth be told, I was bedazzled and enamoured by the view....a whole 6/5!!!

Then comes the hard reality....for the few drinks (7), couple of coffee and a few bites, it was almost ‚Çπ4.2k....time to pay for the view!!!!....maybe a tinge more so 3.5/5....but the few hours spent are worth sitting there provided the company / conversation is good....

Nothing to write home about the food taste, just an avg 3.5/5

In the evening they have a good lighting set up and inspite of the crowd, every table and it's occupants had their own space and not intruded upon....it didn't feel cluttered like other such hallmark Kolkatan joints....would have gone for a 4.5/5 but they totally managed to screw that up with thumping music, which could have been easily done through the softer and low volume lounge music!!!...killed the evening ambience....if the idea was to attract the vibrant gen then they missed the fact that there were a whole lot of couples and a few bunch who were engrossed in their own conversation and seemed a bit irritated with the thumping bass....so here's a 3/5 for ruining the awesome layout and view....

If I would ever come again, it would be for the view and the window seats....but guys, do get some class in the music, the environment should provide for individual space, the layout, lighting, setting and ambience are awesome but your music settings are truly questionable, at least this time round!!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Gupta | 29595954 | 3.0 | 2016-10-23 14:58:41 | I didnt have the food since i wanted north indian cuisine and they dnt serve the same where as Zomato says they serve north indian.... ambience was excellent.... |

Monkey Bar | Sunanda Ghosh | 2720210 | 4.0 | 2016-10-20 12:21:51 | The newest addition to Camac Street, Monkey bar holds the promise of becoming one of the coolest hangouts for GenY. Situated on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building, it offers a panoramic view of the city through huge glass windows and what's more there's even arrangement for outdoor seating. The decor is charming and an awesome background score makes the ambience perfect for chilling out with your friends over great food and drinks. Firstly we ordered a butterfly chicken and duck pita pockets. The chicken was delicious and crispy tossed with bell peppers, chilli flakes and stuffed in crunchy butterfly shells and the duck meat marinated with spices and packed inside soft pita bread created fireworks in our mouths. We also went for a smoked chicken, chicken salami and harissa pizza which was superb, to say the least. There was another Hearty bowl, a heartwarming chicken broth with bean sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, flat noodles and bokchoy sprinkled with chilli oil. We finished off with Mobar Sundae Sandwich, an ice cream cake with nuts layered with nutella and tutti fruti. We also tried their hookah and the shisha is really good and strong. The service is more of less..efficient and the staff polite..but the pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side. They recently acquired their bar license, so would love to drop in again for a taste of their cocktails! |
 
Monkey Bar | Pamela Nandi | 2821382 | 3.0 | 2016-10-20 01:06:16 | No doubt this place has an amazing ambience with an indoor and outdoor seating area styled in the form of british pub, but food and service is very very poor.¬† We went on ashtami night with friends, they took about an hour to prepare the chicken stacked as saslik to grill it. Once served, the dish was just tasteless. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sunrita Sarkar | 804376 | 5.0 | 2016-10-18 22:44:36 | Hi, if you love Calcutta , good music(and by good music I mean led zeppelin and pink flyod and classics as such ) and a brilliant view of Calcutta, this is the place to be. 

We ordered a pack up punch, Sangria and a 100 pipers based cocktail. All three were pretty different and pretty well made. 

We didn't order any food as we were so engrossed in the decor and view. 

The hospitality was brilliant. 

Do give it a visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Aritra Roy | 145459 | 4.5 | 2016-10-17 22:31:23 | Already visited twice in such a short span of opening its doors in Kolkata, Monkey Bar has been fabulous on both occasions. Situated on the top floor of Fort Knox, it provides a magnificent view of the Kolkata skyline with Victoria Memorial, St Pauls Cathedral, Hooghly bridge and the 42 which is the tallest building here.

The food has been great and is presented in a unique way. Ordered Chilli Cheese dragons, Mac and cheese croquettes, Butterfly chicken and Chicken Chimichurri on the first time along with Mangaa mocktail. On the repeat, we ordered Mobar caramel ribs, Tiger beef, Reddys popcorn chicken alongwith a Smoked chicken pizza. In drinks, we had copper monkey , house made ginger beer with a couple of KF ultras.

However special mention must go to the desserts, Snicker bar is just too good while Nolen gur creme brulee was delicious.
They have a small open air area for hookah as well. The service is prompt and the ambience is quite relaxing. The bar looks pretty while the music changes over time with comforting tracks during evening to partying ones as the night progresses on.

Overall, the Kolkata gastropub scene is proud to have Monkey bar in its lineup. Hope it gets better from here.Cant wait to visit soon again :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Rupsha Bhadra | 606325 | 4.5 | 2016-10-16 14:33:22 | Monkey bar in Delhi is a location that is a part of some very special memories so I had really high expectations from its Calcutta counterpart. It certainly did not disappoint. We ordered loaded chicken nachos, the butter chicken kichdi, smoked chicken pizza and others. The butter chicken khichdi was really impressive. So were the cocktails Maanga and Copper monkey. A little on the higher side when it comes to the pocket pinch, monkey bar did live up to all the expectations. And the view is just fantastic. |
 
Monkey Bar | Madhurya Sarkar | 6309371 | 5.0 | 2016-10-16 12:11:35 | Just loved it.
The ambiance, the playlist, the skyline view, the staff management, the food and everything is just superb of this pub. This is located in the 9th floor of Knox building opposite to Urban desi. We visited late afternoon but the best time would be to hit this place in the evening. This can be an ideal place to go a date with your partner :)
The view of St. Paul's Cathedral, Victoria Memorial and Hooghly Bridge adds flavour to their ambiance.
Coming to food we had kingfisher premium beer, chicken wings and chocolate lava cake. All of the dishes were value for money. Overall had an excellent experience.
Coming back soon :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Syed Murtaza Jafar | 32607152 | 5.0 | 2016-10-16 04:52:57 | Ok, so same night we visited The Great Booze Story and Monkey Bar, and I'll say Monkey Bar won big time. Just opposite Urban Desi (will visit soon), good collection of music, courteous and attentive staff, this is one venue that you would want to visit again. The ambience, the view of the The Victoria Memorial is just a sight to look at. Safe to say, I'll be coming back to this place soon |
 
Monkey Bar | Preity | 27451267 | 4.5 | 2016-10-15 21:30:28 | Rare does it happen that you get good food at a bar and by the ambience of this place i expected nothing different..but to my surprise it was a very delightful experience..superbbbb food..good music, not too loud so you can chit chat with your friends..and very courteous staff..overall a very good experience..definitely coming back and soon... |

Monkey Bar | Sankha Sengupta | 1733759 | 4.0 | 2016-10-14 17:13:36 | Been there yesterday night. Had soft to you guys, you people just amazed me by your friendly hospitality.
Specialty thanks to Joy you made my evening remarkable. Monkey people should be proud to have a manager like you. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rashmi Adhikary | 31014016 | 4.5 | 2016-10-14 14:26:12 | We visited Monkey Bar on Saptami evening, and had a spectacular time. The ambience is lively, the music is great, the decor very impressive and the service commendable.  
Now coming to the sumptuous meal; an assortment of drinks - whiskey, tequila, rum, virgin mojita, espresso -  was ordered with starters being Butterfly Chicken and Chicken Chapli. Yes, Butterfly Chicken is a definitely worth a try. In the main course, there was Aunty Vinnie's Berry Pulao. Tiger Beef was so delicious that two more dishes were ordered; this is must-try for beef lovers. This is the first place in Kolkata that I see so many beef dishes being offered. Galouti Killer was the other beef dish ordered and equally palatable. I had Mee Goreng which is an Indonesian dish of spiced noodles and got it topped with chicken. 
Overall, it was a great experience in this newly-opened gastropub. |
 
Monkey Bar | Piyush Dalmia | 15726652 | 4.5 | 2016-10-13 20:42:49 | Another fab newbie in the city

Talk about the Ambience, Food, Service or the Decor, it excels in all

Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building at Camac Street, it offers a spectacular view of the city
 
The Decor and Seating Arrangements are well made 

They got a separate smoking area which is quite airy, and has ample seating space as well

Shisha was pretty decent and lasted quite a while

Now lets talk about the protagonist here

Nachos were crisp and loaded with cheese, the Platter was appealing and featured variety of items whereas the mocktails were on fleek 

But things which really caught our attention were Spaghetti and Paneer Khidchi

While the former was extremely tasty, the latter is a MUST have dish for sure

All in all, it was a happy dining experience for us |
 
Monkey Bar | Arpita Agarwal | 998579 | 4.5 | 2016-10-13 12:39:47 | A new place in town, much awaited. Great ambience! The view is also super!! Maybe they should have had a slightly larger rooftop area. Food is decent too. The nachos were pretty good. The Manga is a must try!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sharmistha Mukherjee | 722185 | 4.5 | 2016-10-12 06:49:58 | If you are in Calcutta and love the skyline and a few drinks to go along with it on a hot, rainy or crisp evening this is the place to be. Monkey Bar in Calcutta is done up beautifully and affords you a view of the Victoria Memorial, St Paul's Cathedral and the Hoogly Bridge. The have cocktails and food over and above what they offer in other cities. The hipster smash is delicious to say the least. As was the bourbon cocktail with almond bitters... |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohit Suryawanshi | 36318376 | 5.0 | 2016-10-11 18:11:29 | My favourite lalmass Takos ,Pizza and Delicious Chillie cheese Dragon.
The friendliness of the staff seems genuine. I have never seen such good customer service as I experienced. |
 
Monkey Bar | FOODBUFFS | 987893 | 4.0 | 2016-10-11 11:16:14 | Visited on Ashtami night.Even though it was a good crowd,we managed to get a table immediately,courtesy to the experienced and efficient management team.There is an open-air seating which mainly caters to people ordering hookah or going there for a puff.Indoor seating is quite large.
Decor is akin to a British pub.Upholstery is comfortable.What allures you are those French windows through which you can catch a great glimpse of the city skyline,from the ninth floor.In the evenings there is muted lighting.Ambience is quite good.We heard some good old day soft music but as the night grew,the DJ started giving groovy yet classy numbers.
Service is warm and polite but there was a lack of professionalism.We were giving the same food order to two or three different men at times.The servers,even though quite courteous,were not quite clearly conversant about the food and beverages,unless asked upon.Details or any recommendations/suggestions were not given on their own.They need to more vocal  and well informed about every detail of the food when the order is being placed.
PAN RASNA HOOKAH-strong flavour,no choking but the smoke was quite weak,unlike to our liking.It was smooth but the smoke didnot last for an hour.It wasnot worth the price charged.Not satisfied.
BUTTERFLY CHICKEN-tastewise quite impressive.Chicken morsels were soft and had a sweet tangy taste.The sauce was pretty good and spicy and the butterfly shells were crispy,the whole presentation looked lovely.Three butterflies were there.
REDDY'S CHICKEN POPCORN-Well this dish took us to South India.Moderately sized chicken morsels deep fried in a batter having a crisp crunchy texture and the taste was so consistent in southern flavours,it tasted good.Curry leaves flavour was predominant and we liked it a lot to go for a second order.
CHICKEN CHIMICHURI-Chicken was soft.They were skewed up but the flavours were quite bland,didnot stand up to our expectations.Not impressive at all,this dish needs improvement.
MEDITERRANEAN PLATTER-Mixed comments.It was great in some parts,not so great in others.Chickpea fries were not so good to taste,seemed a bit too fried where the chickpea stuffing was too less.The pita breads were nice,soft,fluffy,buttered and nicely grilled,tasted good.Hummus was in great quantity,tastewise perfect but the babaghanoush didnot stand out in taste.Cheese filo wraps tasted good.They  had soft spinach with gooey cheese inside wrapped in rice papers and fried.Overall a good dish,you can give it a try if Mediterranean cuisine is your calling.
OLD MONK(EY) CHOCOLATE CAKE-Good.Cake was melt in mouth soft and creamy.Consistency of cream was smooth,light and fluffy.The dessert was classy,superb and hence recommended.
Foodwise we were not that satisfied as much as we were with their cocktails!!
Their BOURBON LIIT,MAD MEN and MAMA'S GIRL were just bang on!The bartender did a great job.The blend was great,the liquor gave a great kick,courtesy the good mixing.They were well balanced in flavours and the ingredients of the drinks very well complimented each other.Spices and mint went well with vodka,and coffee with whisky surely made a great pair.
We also ordered Heineken,Ginger ale and fresh lime soda which was usual.
As far as price is concerned,it is too high for the food and some cocktails! Quantity of food is very less,so doesnot justify the price and tastewise it didnot make a good mark.The cocktails had a price tag which was same as most gastropubs having a good establishment cost,yet they were high.
This pub is a must visit,esp for their awsome cocktails.The gastronome part needs improvement to call it a fair gastropub.Will visit again for sure owing to the overall good experience that we had,a good hangout place and to try other cocktails and entr√©es. |
 
Monkey Bar | Garima Poddar | 2714062 | 3.5 | 2016-10-10 23:22:48 | The ambience n decor is nice..I had ordered fr a peach icetea n it was quite refreshing..the chilli cheese dragon was nt that impressive n lacking chilli..onion n capsicum basically the description was amazing bt it was no where near that..nachos was average..spaghetti in red sauce was again average..green thai curry was really nice n d best part was d dessert mobar sundae sandwhch it was like love at first bite |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohit Misra | 1561408 | 4.5 | 2016-10-10 11:32:08 | Monkey bar has lived upto the expectations. With crazy ambience and amazing service, it just became my favourite destination in town. Also on a special note, Ripon out there was brilliant with his service. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rima Dhara | 1796261 | 2.5 | 2016-10-09 20:08:51 | Nothing great... service is very bad... food is ok.. ambiance is good ... but as a whole coz of service of of the worst place I have ever been.... will not try again ‚òπÔ∏è chicken wasn't fresh... very bad experience ... |
 
Monkey Bar | Sreyashi M. | 10853321 | 4.5 | 2016-10-09 19:05:16 | Visited today for lunch, and a had a lovely time! 
I suggest you get a table by the windows. The Kolkata skyline will definitely make your visit even more memorable. 
We tried the Maanga cocktail (5 stars, peeps!) with the Tiger Beef. I suggest you try both. Succulent meat with the zing of your drink makes for some very happy (read: tipsy) people. 
For mains, we tried the Mobar burger and it was heavenly! The Naga pork soulful bowl was fabulous too! Portions are great, flavour is gorgeous and staff is super sweet and nice. 
I hope you maintain what you've got going so I can visit again! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sudipto Mitra | 2401672 | 3.5 | 2016-10-09 09:00:39 | Nice decor , awsum view of the cityscape and great cocktails . Food is good to average with a twist and may not be liked by all.
We ordered pitchers of pack a punch,mangaa amd mohjito and the first is the best.

We stuck with finger food only and ordered 
Mushroom bruschetta(good),prawn pil pil(gr8), chicken churi(avg) and tiger beef(gr8)
Rounded everything off with aunty berry pulao which was delicious
 This a typical gastro bar with foot tapping music which is too loud at times, we had to ask it to be turned down.

The service could have been bettet and there  was confusion while seating. We were waiting at the bar for our table to be ready but some other guests jumped on that

Oh forgot to mention a outing here will surely burn a whole in your pocket |
 
Monkey Bar | Vedant Kabra | 2240676 | 4.5 | 2016-10-09 08:47:40 | I went to monkey bar last night and I was pretty surprised. Read all the reviews and thoroughly analysed the place in my mind before I went there (it's what I do). 
The guy at the front desk (I believe he was the owner) was phenomenal. So welcoming, so easy going and so 'approachable'. The one at the front desk is the face of any restaurant. He told us we'll have to wait for 40, but we got a table in 20. Told us we'll have to share the table - but eventually we didn't have to. 
I think seating right outside the kitchen + bar worked for us. Didn't have to wait for the food (the cheese drum, nachos and mushroom + truffle oil pizza are INSANE). Ordered quite a bit on the liquor front - barring the martini everything else was really good (fun presentation too!) (including the ginger beer). We had heard so much about the desserts - total let down though (chocolava cake with mint ice cream was terrible I must confess - Mezzuna gets the big ups here). 
The staff was pretty alright (looked a little confused at times). 
Monkey bar must work on guest management (but it is only a few weeks old so it's okay). Thoroughly impressed with the ambience (trumps Mezzuna and all the other hot spots in the city several times over), food, booze and service. 
This place has my highest recommendation. |
 
Monkey Bar | Argha Basu | 1892606 | 5.0 | 2016-10-08 15:46:45 | If you want to impress your girlfriend or wife . Just take her there . Take your seat next to the glass wall and enjoy the panaromic view of the Victoria memorial, Vidyasagar Setu and the Howrah Bridge.

Monkey Bar | Puja Das | 36272619 | 4.5 | 2016-10-08 12:52:12 | Bookmarks . ¬†It's got an amazing atmosphere with outdoor and indoor seating. Despite going on the weekend it gets the right amount of crowd that makes it a very happening place. Music was really good. We wanted to try a new cocktail, so we went for the ¬†toast to calcutta which was a little different and tasted quite good. Food on the other hand was quite unique. 
service is also impressed us. ¬† ¬†

The place is a little hard to find. But overall it's a nice place for the weekend chill! |
 
Monkey Bar | Tejash | 15384381 | 1.5 | 2016-10-08 11:33:48 | Visited this place on 7th October with friends. We were a group of 11 but there is no place for such big group there.  The table we were given was ideal for 7 but we had to squeeze in.  Repeated request for chair felt to deaf ears till such time my friend pulled up the bar chair from the adjacent table. They have limited staff and one server was alloted to the tables.  Needless to say the service was pathetic and totally unacceptable. Our order for beer and ginger ale took 30 mins and after repeated reminders it arrived.  The food is average with limited option for Vegetarian. No one wants to eat "baigan pakora " or " vada pav" at such a place.  We were charged for one item that was ordered but not served. On pointing the same the server "argued" that we didn't realise but it was indeed served to us.  In no mood to hang around any more we just paid and left.  While waiting down for our car we met others who too were very disappointed with the place. 

This will be one of those places in kolkata that will soon be ticked off based on word or mouth and customer experience because of shabby service and attitude of the people who run it. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anshuman Jalan | 31752408 | 2.0 | 2016-10-08 00:20:08 | Good atmoshpere ! Average food for vegie lovers ! Place to chill and soak in the music and buzz around . Nothing home to write about the food . And weekend and holidays . aVOID as unable to give service due to rush |
 
Monkey Bar | Darshana Rampuria | 2855224 | 3.5 | 2016-10-05 11:34:14 | So finally visited Monkey Bar ! The ambience is good as compared to What we get to see in Kolkata.. but apart from that nothing spectacular and surely cannot be compared to the one in Mumbai ! The food is Too average . We had ordered the Nachos - this one was a disaster , pesto spaghetti ( penne pasta wasn't there!!) - yet again very bland and just not up to the mark . Though tempura and mezze platter was good BUT the Coconut ice cream Dessert was FABULOUS SO an extra 0.50 points for that !! Food needs to be worked upon , staff is courteous ! Best wishes .. hoping my next visit be better and with no complains ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sujan Das | 36218418 | 4.5 | 2016-10-03 14:04:44 | I went this place with my friends and I would say this was amazing and was full packed in the weekend without liquor. There ambiance was very good and the music they place is also very nice . There drinks where also very good . They smoking and non smoking area also which was the best part of this place. Good place to spend with your friends. As we been to many other bars but I love this place as they have place to sit and there service was also excellent. They where pack but still there people know how to attend the gust which was very good in this bar. Pocket friendly and staff was excellent smiling and they working and they suggest also if you are new to this place and don't know what to order. I would suggest everyone for this place and sure you will be in love with this place. I basically tried everything on the menu (food and beverage), and yes it is all worth every penny
, I m fan of there menu and food, really enjoyed.¬†

Monkey Bar | Soul !! | 32140714 | 4.5 | 2016-10-03 08:50:51 | In a word, wonderful. We been to Delhi Monkey but this is the best one with wonderful view. 
One thing we really missed the Foosball) 
But no matter we had great time, fantastic food, we order lot many things forget the name but pizza and starters are yumm, drinks are also really nice
Staff were very welcoming too.

So keep good work guys !! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sarat | 8743511 | 3.0 | 2016-10-03 01:16:59 | ambience is good.. was excited to reach the place.. view n open air is also impressive.. u get a glimpse of the Victoria memorial
Although can't talk about the cocktails(coz we wet on 2nd oct, dry day), but we had the copper monkey mocktail and a ginger beer, we were very happy with both
But sadly food was extremely disappointing.. taste as well as quality is not upto the mark.. ordered the much talked about chicken butterfly, too sweet, no flavour of chicken n tasted Lyk beans on toast
Second ordered the spicy tomato spaghetti, worst I hav ever had, tasted like Maggi with tomato
Butter chicken khichadi was good,,, good innovation
Snickerbar, dessert, was well mind blowing if u hav a sweet tooth.. very nice and balanced taste
But the whole dining experience was not satisfactory |
 
Monkey Bar | Nikita Ramgarhia | 903737 | 2.5 | 2016-10-01 10:11:42 | An over hyped place.
The only plus points are the ambience and the service.
The hookah is average and food simply disappoints.
The vada pao is good.
The Mac and cheese croquettes have peas in them..like who does peas with cheese and Mac..
Too bad with the experimentation guys..
And the potato rackett is also very bland.
Galauti is average..
You guys are better in other cities I have heard..so pls improve in Kolkata |
 
Monkey Bar | Bindu | 36159071 | 3.5 | 2016-09-29 00:55:19 | At last chef manu chandra with his concept of monkey bar has entered in Kolkata.but sorry to say the food and service has dissapointed on comparison with the monkey bars in bombay and bangalore.
Need to check before its too late its my first experience but once more will love to try so that they can still improvise. |
 
Monkey Bar | Harish Todi | 1076456 | 2.0 | 2016-09-28 00:28:12 | The place is worst ever in all places that I do visit. What it seems from outside is not at all from inside. It's totally a different one and thats very disappointing for me. The hookah was so bad that I just left it after once. It was all a waste of money for me and that too a huge waste as it is very costly as per their brand name , but it's sad to say that it couldn't carry it'd brand name at all. |
 
Monkey Bar | Hardik Daga || Kolkata Epicurean | 9516701 | 4.0 | 2016-09-26 23:52:06 | Location-Fort knox building(9th floor),Camac street.

Finally "Monkey bar" has opened its gate to kolkata.After establishing itself in Mumbai,Delhi and Bangalore its opening in kolkata was much awaited.This place is totally a fresh take on gastrobar culture.As we entered we were totally astonished with the beauty of this place.The best part about this place was the swanky interiors and the dazzling view.The menu was mouthwatering and creation of one of the finest chef Manu Chandra.But along with whole lot of positive aspects this place has its negative side too and that is its service and price.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is extremely calm and soothing.The interiors are extremely high-toned.The place is divided into two sections(Smoking and Non Smoking area)which is appreciated.And atlast for this segment,we can bet that this place has the best view in comparison to any of the eateries in Kolkata.

Service-We were extremely disappointed with the service at this place.The staff was extremely confused with our seating.They took about 15 minutes to make us sit and also the table on which we were seated was already reserved by someone due to which we have to change our table in between.We also have to urge them many a times to serve us water and take the order for the food.But on the other side we saw that the staff was trained very well with the dishes and helped us to choose the right dishes according to our starvation.

Food-The food at this place was good in taste but what astonished us the most was their presentation,it was just praise-worthy.We had-
1:Med platter
2:Spicy panner bhurji buns
3:Chilli cheese dragons

Among them our favourite was "Med platter".We also had sheesha at this place which we find extremely expensive.It cost us around 800+taxes.

Food-4/5
Service-3/5
Ambiance-4.5/5

Monkey Bar | Ritwika Pal | 172912 | 4.0 | 2016-09-26 10:27:27 | Woo another gastropub in town, I was super excited to explore this new place. Unfortunately they not yet started with alcohol. But yes for compensation they have this Non alcoholic beer in their menu card. Which is more like a ginger ale.¬†
Food is awesome we tried Sticky Korean Chicken Wings and Prawn Pil Pil for which is can give 5/5. |

Monkey Bar | Vikash Kumar Singh | 32056738 | 2.0 | 2016-09-25 23:21:32 | Went to this place on 25th of September. The best part of this hotel is the view of Victoria + Vidyasagar Setu. Food is ok types. Service needs to improve. Didnt like that much. |
 
Monkey Bar | Shakshi Bajaj | 34222951 | 4.0 | 2016-09-25 21:50:03 | Had recently visited the place.  Ambience was really good.  Soothing music and ample space worked well for me.  All the people were very courteous and response was very quick. We ordered nachos,  potato with rachlette cheese and pizza.  The food was yummmm. We asked for out of the menu toppings for pizza and they were more than happy to serve.  It was a pleasant experience. |
 
Monkey Bar | Samrat Banerjee | 984442 | 3.0 | 2016-09-25 18:48:36 | Visited the place on 24Sep. A mix of pro's and cons. Remarkably expensive, considering service is yet to reach premium standards. Yet to get a bar license, staff seems confused about where to seat you if you walk in as a couple. While the outdoor sitting layout is nice, it's primarily used as a hookah space by boisterous youngsters, and the seating layout is remarkably cramped. Service also is a minus here with the server not asking or serving water if not called to do so. Portions are quite small against the charges. Chicken Chimichuri was good, folks lovers which was 3 cutlets of bhekti coated and fried was ok. The mushroom pizza was definitely a let down. With 2 soft drinks the tab came to ‚Çπ1650+. Not worth a revisit soon. |
 
Monkey Bar | Abhishek Agarwal | 2897244 | 3.5 | 2016-09-25 03:13:53 | Was on the bucket list since it opened... So
We ordered a hookah but it failed my expectations... We tried out the tacos which was really nice... Service was on the slower side.... Definitely a lot to improve..
But then having ur food wit hookah nd Victoria memorial to look over.. The view is breathtaking..
But u need to live up to the name...
Hope to b back soon.... Nd wish to see a Better Trained Monkeyüëç |

Monkey Bar | Shourya Sengupta | 2357486 | 4.5 | 2016-09-23 21:51:57 | Brilliant food! Loved the wide choice of meat. Please keep up the good work! Look forward to having the Galouti Killer, next time since it was not available. |
 
Monkey Bar | Siddhi Newatia | 3761881 | 3.0 | 2016-09-23 21:24:05 | Amazing ambience..very spacious, drinks menu could Hav had more variety..hated the mangaa drink..i found it too sour..the pizza and chilli cheese dragons were good. |
 
Monkey Bar | Harsh Bathwal | 1481844 | 3.5 | 2016-09-21 23:42:47 | Visited here for the first time. The food menu is different from what you come across usually in other restaurants. I think it's a perfect date spot as it has a beautiful Victoria building's view which looks amazing at night. Also the music was superb.
Pocket pinch : 600-700 per head. ( Food and mocktail) |
 
Monkey Bar | Shikha Ojha | 2112728 | 4.5 | 2016-09-18 01:48:05 | Amazing decor and awesome food. They had an outdoor sitting too which had a big screen playing Mickie and Minnie black and white cartoon synchronized with the songs being played. The cost is on the higher side but if you want to pamper yourself or people you love, this is the place to be. The amazing view is icing on the cake. |
 
Monkey Bar | Utsav Agarwal | 31137221 | 1.5 | 2016-09-17 22:49:13 | There is a difference in Bangalore wen it compares to Kolkata one , seriously don't no d reason but it needs to upgrade it very soon as in Bangalore. 
Specifically, the property is pretty old for a brand like dis 
According to me Monkey bar is just not another lounge but a more of a culture which in itself |
 
Monkey Bar | Arnav Jhunjhunwala | 22857974 | 5.0 | 2016-09-16 21:28:37 | The best place to hangout now. Food quality is excellent and many of the dishes aren't available anywhere in Kolkata. The key lime pie is unbelievable and a must have each time you go. |
 
Monkey Bar | Tanya Sen | 496614 | 5.0 | 2016-09-15 00:44:28 | The moment you walk in to this restaurant you're going to notice the long french windows and ofcourse the most beautiful view which includes victoria memorial. The ambience is lovely, very warm and urban. We ordered Aam Pannas, Tiger beef, Prawn Ghee Roast, Pepper Calamari. All of them were to die for. For dessert we ordered Nolen gurer creme br√ªl√©e. Yumm yumm!! I would totally come again. Loved itüòä |
 
Monkey Bar | Sourav Mukherjee | 306717 | 4.5 | 2016-09-14 11:38:19 | Finally they have arrived in Kolkata after rocking Delhi , Mumbai , Bangalore etc. and a few of Corporate Monkeys could muster the courage and had enough stock of lame excuses (for residential purposes only) to visit this joint on the lazy Saturday afternoon last week. Very conveniently located at Camac Street , innovative food & drinks menu like Kerala Rice , Butterfly Chicken , Prawn Pil Pil and many more.¬† Personally I loved the ginger beer. It was a full house and it is nice to see that City of Joy has lapped up the Monkey Bar and the legendary versatile gastronomical journey of Kolkata has just added yet another feather . Must visit joint for foodies and a great place to unwind. Wishing luck and Highly recommended !!!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Siddhartha Chowdhary | 211170 | 4.0 | 2016-09-14 00:31:42 | Dim lights and chic interiors. A totally fresh take on gastropub culture. The place was almost full when we entered so 9 of us had to accommodate on a smaller table. They weren't serving alcohol today, and for the next few days also they are keeping the bar closed. we had to compromise on that and had to order the virgins. We had the much hyped 'maanga' which was nice and refreshing. Homemade ginger beer was good. Brownie cookie shake wasn't available. For starters we had chilli cheese dragons, cheese filled cigar rolls with spicy garlic sauce, the sauce was amazing. Rock Corn tempura was good, crisp and the teriyaki sauce was appropriately done. Loaded nachos was amazing. Potato with raclette which was fried potatoes topped with stringy mozzarella cheese, was basic and slightly spiced toped with pickled jalape√±os. We also ordered two types of pizza , roasted zucchini with parmesan and tomatoes and the other, mushrooms with truffle oil. I loved the mushroom one over the zucchini one. But the pizza looked a bit messy and wasn't also evenly crisp. Overall the service was spontaneous and amiable. I liked the overall experience though. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Chopra | 34103337 | 4.5 | 2016-09-13 20:44:04 | Monkey Bar is a grown up version of a slightly more casual neighborhood bar. With about 300+ gastro pubs in India it is only a matter of time when people start aping. The Calcutta version is setting it apart from the rest of the so called gastro pubs.

We had the good fortune of going to the private opening of Monkey Bar Kolkata on the 1st September, 2016. It was a small party for about a 100 people. The mood was up beat and there was a sense of relief and satisfaction on the staff who were hosting us. It has taken Monkey Bar Kolkata a little over 8 months to complete the restaurant.

The staff is from all across the country. This makes for some good interaction with them ‚Äì that is if you care to chat them up. The cocktails are more involved. There is reasonable work that is done to create the drinks behind the counter. Work as in ingredients have been mixed and labor have been put in to create a concoction or mixes. Not just opening bottles and squirting premixes in a shaker and serving things up. Almost like an artisan touch. The bases are fermented in house; you can see the large glass jars filled and sitting happy on the bar counter.

To begins with the view is something you must visit let alone anything else. Add the food and you have method to mayhem. The care that goes in the food here is evident when you have your first bites. With Chef Manu Chandra at the helm of the kitchen things are definitely going to have certain standards in terms of flavor and quality. There is always going to be a reason behind why what ever has been done to the food in the kitchen here at Monkey Bar.

Expect massive flavors and good service. In fact it is so good to see the city opening up to the kinds of Monkey Bar. This is a place where you can come in and kick back with friends on a weekend. This is one tree that we two monkeys are happy to call home. |
 
Monkey Bar | Jayeeta Basu | 360426 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 21:01:52 | So finally Kolkata gets Monkey Bar!! 
I have always loved the Bangalore  and the Mumbai Monkey Bar because of the ambience.  
First day, the space and the view is amazing!! They had a very limited drinks menu considering first day. I had Toast to Calcutta, Manga and Copper Grin. Toast to Calcutta was refreshing, adding smoke gondhoraj lebu,  it tasted even better.  Manga is something I have drank before.  Copper Grin was okay. 
Let's get into the food menu.  Prawn ghee roast,  Vada Pav,  Keema Pav the menu took me back to Bombay and South. 
I had the Korean sticky wings,  since I already came to Monkey Bar  after having dinner,  I sticked to one starter and drinks!
I am planning to head back to Monkey Bar pretty soon for full fledged meal and lot of Toast to Calcutta! 
Please stock the bar as it is extremely disappointing to come to Monkey Bar and sit with limited choices in terms of alcohol. |
 
Monkey Bar | Arushi Dhupia | 1597321 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 19:14:22 | Monkey Bar is on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building on camac. Visit in the evening and if you're sitting by the window panes, you can see the Victoria Memorial, lights twinkling from The 42, and the outline of a part of the Parama flyover. It's so cool! 
The music is good and the place has a very funky feel to it. The food is good, not excellent. 
Loved the pizza and the Med platter.  Corn kernels were okayish. 
The Loaded Nachos were Brilliant!! Lots of sour cream and Mexican beans and fully loaded as the name suggests! No other places in kolkata (apart from the Big Nachos at |
 
Monkey Bar | Shhashee Churiwala | 2053496 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 23:48:39 | The newest hub in kolkata with different design and fresco depicting old kolkata. The giant size windows showing the serene skyline of the city. Exhaustive menu with both indian and international cuisine with a twist. Prompt service , great tasting dishes both starters and mains accompanied humble pricing. A great place to kill your hunger. All in all good experience after a long time. A must visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Aihik Barua | 1850614 | 3.5 | 2016-09-11 22:10:16 | This review might change. This post is influenced mostly due to the nonavailability of alcohol , and I did see two or three bottles of liquor , anyway , about the interiors and location , bloody superb amazing selection , love it , would suggest it anybody , the bartenders ( coke tenders üòÇ) seemed cocky , but it's a relief to see a high end restaurant serving beef, that's fresh and the it was good actually , would go again for the booze ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Mansi Tulshan | 33240285 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 21:17:40 | Went there in the evening today to check out all the hype surrounding it. Guess what! Wasn't disappointed at all. We took a seat right next to the window(yes, I have a fascination for tables next to Windows) and was mesmerised by the breathtaking view of the city. The music, ambience were perfect for a chilled out evening with a great date(note:my husband).
The lemon iced tea was very good.. Perfect in taste. The staff recommended ' the med platter 'as a great vegetarian option and we decided to try that. The platter had falafel, pita pockets, cheese and spinach filos, and the usual dips. The hummus was great and we were serves a hearty portion if it which made us happy coz it's the dips which usually are heroes of this dish. The babagonoush was great and it had a smokey taste which was really good. The curd and cucumber dip definitely needs improvement. It was runny and tasted like buttermilk! Had no taste and we left most of it. The best part of the ambience was hookah had a separate enclosure and wasn't served inside the main restaurant! Will definitely return to this place for a relaxing evening! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sajid Feroz | 60540 | 1.0 | 2016-09-11 17:20:01 | New place and pathetic service....guy at the reception refused to give a table coz I was alone and suggested a table outside in open when it was so  hot outside.After a while I was a given a table with no seat n ws suggested to stand n eat (brilliant!) Although after some protest a seat was provided.i even noticed couples were asked to share a table even when some of the tables were empty ! It was quite bizzare !! imagine going on a double date with some strangers ! It was like they just wanted to give table to group of 4 or more ,again like I said restaurant was not even full!

Food was served ..I ordered a prawn dish ,peach ice tea and the snicker bar for dessert.prawn dish was good ,the ice tea wasn't served n after 45 minutes of ordering I was told it's not available .the snicker bar was good (recommended) !! Some how all the servers were lost in their own world ,roaming around in groups n hardly paying attention to customers ..that too when there was no rush at all ! 
 
I am not tat critical while writing reviews but m quite surprised how casual the staff was while handling their customers (that too being a new place in town).I have been to monkey bar in Delhi and tat place is amazing ! 

Service - 0/5
Decor -4/5 (lovely view of Victoria memorial n hoogly bridge ) 
Food - 3.5 (would love to explore more) 

Must have - the snicker bar |
 
Monkey Bar | Aadarsh Agarwal | 1183989 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 17:18:45 | The ambience and location of the place was top notch. With the bar not licensed yet the food surely compensated. There is a separate outdoor section for shisha takers. Lastly, the view of Victoria was the cherry on the cake. |
 
Monkey Bar | Reevu Wangdi | 284286 | 5.0 | 2016-09-11 00:42:46 | Great place to chill & dine... best thing is they serve beef...Tiger beef was succulent and spiced to perfection... Korean bulgogi beef rice was flavoursome ... chorizo pork pav was delicious... ampanna done right... and service was tops... gonna be back when the bar opens ..I believe next week it is... good going .. |
 
Monkey Bar | Devanshi Powani | 33090142 | 3.5 | 2016-09-10 23:54:27 | The snicker bar desert and the Aam aadmi eggs were the highlight of our dinner. Can't wait for the bar to start . Loved the service and the ambience. |
 
Monkey Bar | Jashita Ray | 589467 | 4.0 | 2016-09-09 19:52:29 | Had been waiting eagerly for the opening of Monkey Bar and there I was dragging my fiance, paying a visit in the first week itself. However I would say i rather got slightly disappointed. The staff seemed amateur. They were very amiable but highly confused. Firstly it took them over 20-25mins with repetitive reminders to serve us water. And further disappointment was on asking for the drinks menu, they informed us they didn't have license for alcohol. Thus we had to settle for mocktails. The person who took our mocktail order was so confused. He was unsure of the mocktails on offer, we had to specifically cue him with names like green apple or blue lagoon etc. And oh, there was no paper napkins, spoons and forks or sauces kept on the table for us as some had mentioned in previous reviews - we had to ask for them. Probably they don't have them kept in advance in the open air section.
Now the good part - Everything else!
The ambience - Wow. The view of the Victoria Memorial is simply stunning. You can just sit and spend hours adoring your surroundings.
We ordered a teen paan hookah, along with a Virgin Mangaa- Loved it and a Green Apple Soda which was decent, not that great. Next on our list were the Butterflies, Rooster Booster Burger & Chicken 65. The first two were mouthwatering, especially the burger - juicy, filling, yummilicious. And then the cherry on the pie - the dessert - Snicker bar- I genuinely recommend this. Loved the way they serve it and the taste is heavenly.
Overall, had a lovely evening with the MoBar Mojo! Just wished I could give it a 5 star rating. |
 
Monkey Bar | Luna Chatterjee (Madly_Food_Lover) | 1304639 | 4.5 | 2016-09-09 01:36:56 | The Monkey has finally swung east, and that too it's making it's presence felt !! After Mumbai and Delhi now Kolkata hasit own "Monkey Bar". 
To start with It's an amazing property that has a breathtaking view. You can just gaze at Kolkata skyline while sipping some amazing cocktails.
Curated by acclaimed chef Manu Chandra, Monkey Bar's menu boasts of innovative food and drinks. I absolutely loved each and everything that i tasted but some of the items and drinks need spl mention.
Kerala Rice Salad- A salad made with wild red rice, blended with herbs and topped with curd chilli, the dish is indigenous and light.
Med Platter-A dish which is a visual delight in itself apart from being a total amalgamation of fritters and dips.
Tikki of Joy- A perfect dish to satisfy the bong fish craving.
Butterfly Chicken- Chicken blended with herbs placed inside a butterfly shaped shell.
Prawn Pil Pil- Perfectly prepared Prawn served with bread. Simple yet delicious
Laal Maas Phulka Tacos-Rajasthani laal mash intelligently placed inside tacos, a perfect fusion food.
Spare Pork Ribs- This is ansolutely recommended for those pork lovers. The meat is tender and cooked to perfection in barbecue sauce.
The drinks served quenched our thirst perfectly, among them some needs spl mentionlike Manga, Copper Monkey, Pink Punch. 
The desserts are absolutely delightful.Gondhoraj Lemon Tart is sweet, with a bit of tang!! There is Snicker Bar whichbis total bliss.
So with the coming of Monkey Bar i can safely say that gastronomic revolution has indeed hit our City of Joy. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anamitraa/The Gut Filling | 671420 | 4.0 | 2016-09-09 00:46:21 | The City of Joy is witnessing a major change in the gastronomic culture post the technological revolution of smartphones and wireless technology. There has been evolution of the global food and Calcuttans are gradually getting used to it. After many multinational and national pubs coming to Kolkata, it was the turn for Monkey Bar to refresh Kolkata with its gracious presence.

This 3rd September, I was invited to the Pre Launch of the Kolkata Chapter where the #MonkeySwungEast. It was a lovely happy afternoon where all the foodies, bloggers, critics and experts had a gala time with beautiful cocktails, mocktails and great good.

The place is located at the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building in Camac Street. Blessed with a wonderful view, you can see the Victoria Memorial, St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral and Hooghly Bridge altogether. We had to pick up paper pieces with names of cocktails and sit at the assigned table to participate in games and quizzes. It was a lot of fun. Ambience is all classy with the bar and high chair along with couches. I loved the wall art on the gateway to the open air sitting area which is done with Gupi Bagha, Tana Rickshaw and all the nostalgic memoirs of Kolkata.

The food was equally good. There were many cocktails and I, being a teetotaler had the virgin versions of all the drinks. Some of them were great, actually. We had ‚Äì

Kerala Red Rice Salad - Baby spinach, red rice, raw mango, coconut, peanuts and upmensinkai (salted chilli from Karnataka). I generally do not eat chillies, but this one was so good. Loved it a lot.

Mac & Cheese Croquettes ‚Äì Golden fried broccoli and peas along with chilli mayo and salsa. I am a fan of cheese. So the croquettes were really admired.

Med Platter - Falafel, spinach, cheese filo parcels, hummus, smoked baba ganoush, roasted peppers, olives, with pita bread and labneh. The presentation of this platter was really an eye catching one. It was really good.

Smoked Beetroot and Beans Galouti - Melt in mouth vegetarian galouti on saffron laced taftan, onion and mint chutney. This dish too was okay.

Baked Brie ‚Äì Oh! I loved this dish. Brie cheese with filo surrounded by pineapple salsa. The cheese oozing out of the pastry created all the sensation. Loved this dish a lot. Had a huge share of it from my table.

Prawn Pil Pil - Tossed in olive oil with chilli, garlic and parsley. It was served with garlic rubbed toast. This was extremely delicious. Loved the dish a lot specially for its aroma and the garlic breads, specially.

Tikki of Joy - Kolkata inspired Bhetki fish cutlets with kasundi, fennel seed & coriander, served with mint chutney. This is one classic dish which no Calcuttan will ever fail to love. I was no exception.

Tiger Beef - Slices of steak tossed with chilli paste, black beans, galangal, ginger, bean sprouts, lemon, bok choy and peppers. This dish was a bit spicy, not suited to my taste but loved by my fellow foodies at the table.

Butterfly Chicken - Sweet, spicy, crispy bits of chicken tossed with sesame, chilli, honey and peppers; stuffed in our signature butterfly shells. The butterfly shells resembled to a savoury treat from the lands of Andhra Pradesh, popularly known as Phoolbu. This dish was unique, in presentation and taste.

Laal Maas Phulka Tacos ‚Äì Who doesn‚Äôt know about this classical delicacy of Rajasthan? Monkey Bar has successfully fused this Indian beauty along with Mexican Tacos. This twist in the cuisines creates the beauty of the culinary culture and here lies the skill of a chef, who is an artist in this case. Loved this dish for the innovation.

Spare Pork Ribs ‚Äì Trust me, it is the best pork dish I have had till date. The pork was so soft, juicy and tender that it literally melted inside the mouth. It was tossed in a tangy and sweet sauce which was really good. Writing the review after 5-6 days but I still can‚Äôt get over the beauty of the pork ribs.

Gondhoraj Lime Tart ‚Äì This was one unique dessert we have tried there. Lemon curd, torched meringue, lemon & mint gel, pistachio cake & cookie crust ‚Äì combination of all good things at one go. Loved the refreshing vibe of this dessert.

The Snicker Bar ‚Äì I am not a big Snicker fan. But this dessert along with the perfect swirls of the s‚Äômore has become one of the desserts to crave for at the strangest of times. Milk chocolate ganache, dark chocolate micro cake, hazelnut praline cream, salted caramel gel being the composition of this dessert, I loved it till the end.

Drinks ‚Äì Copper Monkey, Manga, Pack of Punch, Toast To Calcutta, Mad Men. I was in Team Copper Monkey. Had the virgin version of all the drinks. Liked the Manga to be the best, which they claim to be one of their signature cocktails along with Copper Monkey, which was also very good.

I would like to thank the nationally acclaimed figure Chef Manu Chandra to spend and share his valuable words about food and Team Monkey Bar for having us over and presenting a lifetime of memories. Best wishes to the team and may they prosper ahead. Happy Dining! :) |
 
Monkey Bar | The Hungry Desis (Ramya & Chiranjeev) | 30569103 | 4.5 | 2016-09-08 16:29:59 | Monkey Bar has finally come to the City of Joy and promises to be a perfect place to have fun and relax. When we walked into the gastropub, the first thing that came to our minds was "classy and quirky".¬†
The best of it all is the stunning view.  You have a clear sight of the St. Paul's Cathedral and the Victoria Memorial in the distance. The service staff are swift and attentive.
 Another thoughtful design is the assortment of condiments and cutlery set on the tables. You can use them as you like instead of calling for the servers everytime. The cocktails are innovative, using a variety of ingredients and the food is lip-smackingly delicious! Our recommendations are the Mangaa and the Tipsy Sherbet among the drinks. With regards to the food, the vegetarian dishes are as good as the non vegetarian ones. We suggest the Med Platter and the Baked Brie among the vegetarian choices. For the non-vegetarians, the Prawn Pil Pil is a must try. To achieve full satiisfaction, do sample the Snicker Bar..it is to die for! |
 
Monkey Bar | Varnika | 380228 | 4.5 | 2016-09-07 10:06:59 | The wait is finally over. The moment you enter Monkey Bar, you get the feel of the one in Bangalore. The open air area is simply amazing, the view of Victoria Memorial is breathtaking. 
I loved the ambience of the inner section as well. Even though it has some basic monkey bar elements missing the place is great overall. 
We ordered the MoBar Classic Chilli Cheese Dragons which were to die for. 
For drinks we had the Copper One which was quite bad. It didn't taste of Alcohol at all. 
Taste of Calcutta was refreshing and nice. Pack a punch was also decent. 
All in all once they start functioning full time and properly it will be a great place. Super excited! |
 
Monkey Bar | Roli Vajpeyi | 909801 | 5.0 | 2016-09-06 23:07:49 | Monkey bar finally opens in Kolkata! You guys are in for a treat the cocktails are so unique and nice you can't just order one! And the snacks are just awesome. This is my new hang out place. The desserts specially the snickers one is just amazing. |

Saldanha Bakery | Shaurya Pathak | 367302 | 4.0 | 2016-12-17 21:09:23 | It will be a time taking process to find this place. But it will test your resolve for the love of food.
Don't look around. Just look down and enjoy the lip smacking goodies. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Kashif Ahmed | 1115831 | 4.5 | 2016-12-14 19:10:28 | Surprisingly, this joint serves the best Walnut Cakes i have ever tasted in my life..... It is a very old bakery.... The patties is also lip smacking....
Strongly recommend the Walnut Cake, try it once....But kindly refrain from taking your vehicle as parking is a serious pain..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Amrita Mondal | 36255179 | 4.0 | 2016-10-28 21:36:46 | The best bakery in town for traditional Christmas goodies like fruit cake, walnut cake, plain butter cake, plum cake, Brownies, tarts, etc. It is a place where bulk orders are taken generally. It is not a shop or a cafe. It is a bakery where you order stuff and take away. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tuks4 | 36484659 | 4.5 | 2016-10-25 00:29:07 | ive been an indirect customer of this bakery for a while.. my sis's school orders their items regularly and i get to taste them too :)
this time though, i went to the place & had my own order.. a good number of chicken & corn envelope & choc truffle cake, both eggless & w/ egg..

my 1 line verdict.. the BEST bakery in the city.. period. in terms of taste + price + raw materials + the care + the old-school process, this is without doubt the best place in Calcutta.. & i repeat CALCUTTA and not kolkatta or kolkutta or some other rubbish misnaming this city gets !
this is the place that makes proper patties, proper macrones, cakes & pastries.. almost all of their items taste uniquely clean & refined.. and someone with a decent palette, will feel the 'non-commercial' taste as well..

i had a client team visiting from Poland who were extremely happy eating these items..¬† chicken envelope is their costliest item @35 a pc.. v filling yet flaky & light.. the choc truffle cake melted away inside the mouth.. super soft !
ul see amul butter being used to fry the onions.. pure almond crumbs being used inside the cake's base.. egg whites been beaten for 30mins until those nice soft peaks show up.. no wonder the taste is superlative !

few downsides to mention.. the cheese puff is not good at all.. slice cakes are sometimes stiff.. the place can do better without being that cluttery.. someone with a nose for hygiene might not be thrilled with all the 'hands' being used.. but i guess that too is their USP at some point :) |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anushka Agarwal | 34748091 | 3.5 | 2016-10-24 11:21:12 | Been to this joint lately and loved their brownies and cakes. They are freshly baked and delicious both at the same time. Usually if you go to this place during late evening you'll miss out on most of the stuffs. Pre-ordering recommended. ‚úåüèªÔ∏è |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Debadyuti Karan | 5018051 | 4.0 | 2016-08-30 22:52:05 | Kolkata is full of sweet surprises. Who would ever guess that an old yellow house in central Kolkata houses one of the best bakeries in town?! A cake lovers paradise, this bakery is famous for its weddings cakes for the Anglo Indians. Good things don't come easy; one needs to make an effort to relish their creations. A pre order is a must at this 80 year old bakery. While most of their stuff is good, the must must must on the order list would be their almond cake, coconut macaroons and their soft moist dark brownies. If you are lucky and drop by you might find some' bakes' of the day that you could pick up. Debra Saldanha one of the daughters now runs the place and maintains the high quality standard set by her parents. The place is not a fancy store. They know their quality is far better than most bakeries in town and they let their baking do the talking. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Rajtilak Bhattacharjee | 68484 | 5.0 | 2016-08-20 22:28:12 | The best bakery in Kolkata. Must try their almond cakes, macaroons, and chocolate fudges. You can pre-order, although there is no home delivery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Indrajit Lahiri | 542545 | 4.5 | 2016-08-02 16:47:16 | There goes around a story in Kolkata gastronomic circuit that the best traditional l anglo-Indian cakes are found not in fancy hotels, but in few homes, and over the period of time, they‚Äôve become legends. Many have heard of the name, but few have actually been there, the name‚Äôs Saldanha Bakery and Confectionary

One should reach Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road (the tram road) and find out the B C Sen Jewellery shop on it. While in the afternoon, the traffic moves towards north, it comes on the right hand side. Take the adjacent lane and after 50-100 mtrs, you can find a yellow house on your left with Saldanha written on the outside wall. Parking is a big big problem. Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tisyaketu Sirkar | 3479861 | 5.0 | 2016-07-14 13:57:20 | This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Sumit Surai | 11641 | 4.0 | 2016-07-13 22:52:39 | This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Arjun Kumar Roy | 33434945 | 5.0 | 2016-05-18 00:48:34 | Its an amazing bakery where we get great some authentic baked products. Please try their cakes, mousses and other stuff... Its one the oldest in our city and serves you upto your expectations... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anwesha Ghosh | 14295941 | 3.5 | 2016-02-12 19:26:47 | One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Jude Martin | 1895578 | 4.0 | 2016-01-26 23:48:16 | Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Suhail Hassan | 684685 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 15:28:43 | Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items**** |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Koushik Paul | 16411585 | 4.5 | 2016-01-09 10:10:47 | What to say about this!! It is actually a hidden gem! One of my friend suggested this for Christmas cake shopping. It made us tired to find it out but cakes are actually superb!!! |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Oindrila Paul | 16152668 | 5.0 | 2016-01-08 00:38:34 | I will give 5 stars to this bakery because I've eaten here many a times and if has never let me down. Right from it's vegetarian items to the non vegetarian ones, and from the pastries to the cakes, Saldanha is pure bliss |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Madhurya Chaudhuri | 30816267 | 4.5 | 2016-01-06 21:09:10 | Awesome cakes,brownies,lemon drops and chicken patties . British cakes are the best. Assorted chocolates are good too. And everything comes in a very reasonable price. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Swarnendu Chandra | 32142557 | 5.0 | 2016-01-02 14:06:38 | I visited this place after reading a report in a local newspaper, and experience was mesmerizing. The walnut cake and fruit cake was simply delicious. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Souvik Sen | 9493051 | 4.5 | 2015-12-29 16:56:20 | Great Cakes I must say...This year I had their walnut & chocolate cakes in Christmas...Both was fabulous...Walnut was better...Price was INR 220/- per cake but considering the quality it really worth it..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Apple Orange | 31197595 | 5.0 | 2015-12-25 17:26:35 | I have never been to the shop but in our office every year during Christmas we get cakes from Saldanah Bakery and it is never enough...The Christmas cakes are simply what a first class cake should be...soft ...fresh and...the level sweetness is just right..love it every year and now it's  a ritual...will be visiting soon..üòäüòäüòä |

Saldanha Bakery | Tuks4 | 36484659 | 4.5 | 2016-10-25 00:29:07 | ive been an indirect customer of this bakery for a while.. my sis's school orders their items regularly and i get to taste them too :)
this time though, i went to the place & had my own order.. a good number of chicken & corn envelope & choc truffle cake, both eggless & w/ egg..

my 1 line verdict.. the BEST bakery in the city.. period. in terms of taste + price + raw materials + the care + the old-school process, this is without doubt the best place in Calcutta.. & i repeat CALCUTTA and not kolkatta or kolkutta or some other rubbish misnaming this city gets !
this is the place that makes proper patties, proper macrones, cakes & pastries.. almost all of their items taste uniquely clean & refined.. and someone with a decent palette, will feel the 'non-commercial' taste as well..

i had a client team visiting from Poland who were extremely happy eating these items..¬† chicken envelope is their costliest item @35 a pc.. v filling yet flaky & light.. the choc truffle cake melted away inside the mouth.. super soft !
ul see amul butter being used to fry the onions.. pure almond crumbs being used inside the cake's base.. egg whites been beaten for 30mins until those nice soft peaks show up.. no wonder the taste is superlative !

few downsides to mention.. the cheese puff is not good at all.. slice cakes are sometimes stiff.. the place can do better without being that cluttery.. someone with a nose for hygiene might not be thrilled with all the 'hands' being used.. but i guess that too is their USP at some point :) |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anushka Agarwal | 34748091 | 3.5 | 2016-10-24 11:21:12 | Been to this joint lately and loved their brownies and cakes. They are freshly baked and delicious both at the same time. Usually if you go to this place during late evening you'll miss out on most of the stuffs. Pre-ordering recommended. ‚úåüèªÔ∏è |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Debadyuti Karan | 5018051 | 4.0 | 2016-08-30 22:52:05 | Kolkata is full of sweet surprises. Who would ever guess that an old yellow house in central Kolkata houses one of the best bakeries in town?! A cake lovers paradise, this bakery is famous for its weddings cakes for the Anglo Indians. Good things don't come easy; one needs to make an effort to relish their creations. A pre order is a must at this 80 year old bakery. While most of their stuff is good, the must must must on the order list would be their almond cake, coconut macaroons and their soft moist dark brownies. If you are lucky and drop by you might find some' bakes' of the day that you could pick up. Debra Saldanha one of the daughters now runs the place and maintains the high quality standard set by her parents. The place is not a fancy store. They know their quality is far better than most bakeries in town and they let their baking do the talking. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Rajtilak Bhattacharjee | 68484 | 5.0 | 2016-08-20 22:28:12 | The best bakery in Kolkata. Must try their almond cakes, macaroons, and chocolate fudges. You can pre-order, although there is no home delivery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Indrajit Lahiri | 542545 | 4.5 | 2016-08-02 16:47:16 | There goes around a story in Kolkata gastronomic circuit that the best traditional l anglo-Indian cakes are found not in fancy hotels, but in few homes, and over the period of time, they‚Äôve become legends. Many have heard of the name, but few have actually been there, the name‚Äôs Saldanha Bakery and Confectionary

One should reach Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road (the tram road) and find out the B C Sen Jewellery shop on it. While in the afternoon, the traffic moves towards north, it comes on the right hand side. Take the adjacent lane and after 50-100 mtrs, you can find a yellow house on your left with Saldanha written on the outside wall. Parking is a big big problem. Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tisyaketu Sirkar | 3479861 | 5.0 | 2016-07-14 13:57:20 | This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Sumit Surai | 11641 | 4.0 | 2016-07-13 22:52:39 | This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Arjun Kumar Roy | 33434945 | 5.0 | 2016-05-18 00:48:34 | Its an amazing bakery where we get great some authentic baked products. Please try their cakes, mousses and other stuff... Its one the oldest in our city and serves you upto your expectations... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anwesha Ghosh | 14295941 | 3.5 | 2016-02-12 19:26:47 | One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Jude Martin | 1895578 | 4.0 | 2016-01-26 23:48:16 | Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Suhail Hassan | 684685 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 15:28:43 | Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items**** |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Koushik Paul | 16411585 | 4.5 | 2016-01-09 10:10:47 | What to say about this!! It is actually a hidden gem! One of my friend suggested this for Christmas cake shopping. It made us tired to find it out but cakes are actually superb!!! |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Oindrila Paul | 16152668 | 5.0 | 2016-01-08 00:38:34 | I will give 5 stars to this bakery because I've eaten here many a times and if has never let me down. Right from it's vegetarian items to the non vegetarian ones, and from the pastries to the cakes, Saldanha is pure bliss |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Madhurya Chaudhuri | 30816267 | 4.5 | 2016-01-06 21:09:10 | Awesome cakes,brownies,lemon drops and chicken patties . British cakes are the best. Assorted chocolates are good too. And everything comes in a very reasonable price. |

Saldanha Bakery | Apple Orange | 31197595 | 5.0 | 2015-12-25 17:26:35 | I have never been to the shop but in our office every year during Christmas we get cakes from Saldanah Bakery and it is never enough...The Christmas cakes are simply what a first class cake should be...soft ...fresh and...the level sweetness is just right..love it every year and now it's  a ritual...will be visiting soon..üòäüòäüòä |

few downsides to mention.. the cheese puff is not good at all.. slice cakes are sometimes stiff.. the place can do better without being that cluttery.. someone with a nose for hygiene might not be thrilled with all the 'hands' being used.. but i guess that too is their USP at some point :) |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anushka Agarwal | 34748091 | 3.5 | 2016-10-24 11:21:12 | Been to this joint lately and loved their brownies and cakes. They are freshly baked and delicious both at the same time. Usually if you go to this place during late evening you'll miss out on most of the stuffs. Pre-ordering recommended. ‚úåüèªÔ∏è |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Debadyuti Karan | 5018051 | 4.0 | 2016-08-30 22:52:05 | Kolkata is full of sweet surprises. Who would ever guess that an old yellow house in central Kolkata houses one of the best bakeries in town?! A cake lovers paradise, this bakery is famous for its weddings cakes for the Anglo Indians. Good things don't come easy; one needs to make an effort to relish their creations. A pre order is a must at this 80 year old bakery. While most of their stuff is good, the must must must on the order list would be their almond cake, coconut macaroons and their soft moist dark brownies. If you are lucky and drop by you might find some' bakes' of the day that you could pick up. Debra Saldanha one of the daughters now runs the place and maintains the high quality standard set by her parents. The place is not a fancy store. They know their quality is far better than most bakeries in town and they let their baking do the talking. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Rajtilak Bhattacharjee | 68484 | 5.0 | 2016-08-20 22:28:12 | The best bakery in Kolkata. Must try their almond cakes, macaroons, and chocolate fudges. You can pre-order, although there is no home delivery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Indrajit Lahiri | 542545 | 4.5 | 2016-08-02 16:47:16 | There goes around a story in Kolkata gastronomic circuit that the best traditional l anglo-Indian cakes are found not in fancy hotels, but in few homes, and over the period of time, they‚Äôve become legends. Many have heard of the name, but few have actually been there, the name‚Äôs Saldanha Bakery and Confectionary

One should reach Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road (the tram road) and find out the B C Sen Jewellery shop on it. While in the afternoon, the traffic moves towards north, it comes on the right hand side. Take the adjacent lane and after 50-100 mtrs, you can find a yellow house on your left with Saldanha written on the outside wall. Parking is a big big problem. Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tisyaketu Sirkar | 3479861 | 5.0 | 2016-07-14 13:57:20 | This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Sumit Surai | 11641 | 4.0 | 2016-07-13 22:52:39 | This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Arjun Kumar Roy | 33434945 | 5.0 | 2016-05-18 00:48:34 | Its an amazing bakery where we get great some authentic baked products. Please try their cakes, mousses and other stuff... Its one the oldest in our city and serves you upto your expectations... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anwesha Ghosh | 14295941 | 3.5 | 2016-02-12 19:26:47 | One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Jude Martin | 1895578 | 4.0 | 2016-01-26 23:48:16 | Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Suhail Hassan | 684685 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 15:28:43 | Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items**** |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Koushik Paul | 16411585 | 4.5 | 2016-01-09 10:10:47 | What to say about this!! It is actually a hidden gem! One of my friend suggested this for Christmas cake shopping. It made us tired to find it out but cakes are actually superb!!! |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Oindrila Paul | 16152668 | 5.0 | 2016-01-08 00:38:34 | I will give 5 stars to this bakery because I've eaten here many a times and if has never let me down. Right from it's vegetarian items to the non vegetarian ones, and from the pastries to the cakes, Saldanha is pure bliss |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Madhurya Chaudhuri | 30816267 | 4.5 | 2016-01-06 21:09:10 | Awesome cakes,brownies,lemon drops and chicken patties . British cakes are the best. Assorted chocolates are good too. And everything comes in a very reasonable price. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Swarnendu Chandra | 32142557 | 5.0 | 2016-01-02 14:06:38 | I visited this place after reading a report in a local newspaper, and experience was mesmerizing. The walnut cake and fruit cake was simply delicious. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Souvik Sen | 9493051 | 4.5 | 2015-12-29 16:56:20 | Great Cakes I must say...This year I had their walnut & chocolate cakes in Christmas...Both was fabulous...Walnut was better...Price was INR 220/- per cake but considering the quality it really worth it..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Apple Orange | 31197595 | 5.0 | 2015-12-25 17:26:35 | I have never been to the shop but in our office every year during Christmas we get cakes from Saldanah Bakery and it is never enough...The Christmas cakes are simply what a first class cake should be...soft ...fresh and...the level sweetness is just right..love it every year and now it's  a ritual...will be visiting soon..üòäüòäüòä |

Saldanha Bakery | Shaurya Pathak | 367302 | 4.0 | 2016-12-17 21:09:23 | It will be a time taking process to find this place. But it will test your resolve for the love of food.
Don't look around. Just look down and enjoy the lip smacking goodies. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Kashif Ahmed | 1115831 | 4.5 | 2016-12-14 19:10:28 | Surprisingly, this joint serves the best Walnut Cakes i have ever tasted in my life..... It is a very old bakery.... The patties is also lip smacking....
Strongly recommend the Walnut Cake, try it once....But kindly refrain from taking your vehicle as parking is a serious pain..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Amrita Mondal | 36255179 | 4.0 | 2016-10-28 21:36:46 | The best bakery in town for traditional Christmas goodies like fruit cake, walnut cake, plain butter cake, plum cake, Brownies, tarts, etc. It is a place where bulk orders are taken generally. It is not a shop or a cafe. It is a bakery where you order stuff and take away. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tuks4 | 36484659 | 4.5 | 2016-10-25 00:29:07 | ive been an indirect customer of this bakery for a while.. my sis's school orders their items regularly and i get to taste them too :)
this time though, i went to the place & had my own order.. a good number of chicken & corn envelope & choc truffle cake, both eggless & w/ egg..

my 1 line verdict.. the BEST bakery in the city.. period. in terms of taste + price + raw materials + the care + the old-school process, this is without doubt the best place in Calcutta.. & i repeat CALCUTTA and not kolkatta or kolkutta or some other rubbish misnaming this city gets !
this is the place that makes proper patties, proper macrones, cakes & pastries.. almost all of their items taste uniquely clean & refined.. and someone with a decent palette, will feel the 'non-commercial' taste as well..

i had a client team visiting from Poland who were extremely happy eating these items..¬† chicken envelope is their costliest item @35 a pc.. v filling yet flaky & light.. the choc truffle cake melted away inside the mouth.. super soft !

Monkey Bar | Sirsha Dhar | 2015246 | 4.5 | 2016-12-15 21:54:11 | My friend, who was leaving the city soon wanted to go out for food and drinks and what could have been better than our decision to hit the Monkey Bar. Finally opened in Kolkata, one of the best-located bar there possibly is. On the 9th floor of Fort Knox on Camac Street, this looks down the beautiful Kolkata skyline with the 2nd bridge, Victoria, St. Pauls church and what not. The place is huge, quaintly decorated with the essential Bong touch both in the menu and the bar. Has an open area with a huge screen. 
For food we ordered the Mobar Caramelised Pork Ribs. Melt in the mouth pork meat. Smoked Chicken, Chicken Salami and Harissa pizza. For drinks we took the Beamer LIIT. Just the right punch of alcohol and tang! Lovely experience. Would definitely like to go back again. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohan Belani | 3081061 | 3.5 | 2016-12-15 02:58:39 | The place has a chill vibe . Went with a few school buddies.  There is a open air section as well as an indoor section where you can sit and chill . Drinks were nice . Service could be better . The staff were not attentive enough . Lastly the music . There were people singing karaoke. I mean it's cool to sing and all but we expected some chill music with the setting . |
 
Monkey Bar | Pratik Shah | 31614924 | 3.0 | 2016-12-14 13:50:20 | With an indoor and outdoor seating options and great ambience "monkey bar" is sure to impress you . I didnt order much to eat , bt watever i ordered was average - 
Yes it is lil on the expensive side - overall good place to chill once in a while . |
 
Monkey Bar | Shruti Bhaiya | 593379 | 4.0 | 2016-12-11 17:47:13 | A must go places for the party peeps in kolkata.  Good food , good music and an awesome ambience. .  A complete thumbs up .. the only thumbs down would be the quantity  of the food served , it's too little and gives u just a taste of the dish !! |
 
Monkey Bar | Avinaba Das Sarkar | 409341 | 3.0 | 2016-12-11 11:02:59 | Went yesterday with a business partner, wasn't really very particular about a place but since it was located near by thought of visiting it once. Few observations

1. The ambiance is nice and the interiors are pretty well done.

2. Music is pretty loud and if you are intending to have a prolonged conversation with someone it would be difficult. 

3. The biggest drawback is the food, we ordered two veg starters since my friend was veg. The quantity and the taste wasn't something justifying the price or the brand. The food was OK but it isn't something one will find difficult to prepare in there kitchen. 

Overall experience was okay since we primarily went there to seat and talk. But comparing the same with the likes to cafe mezzuna or the grid would make this place average at the best. Hope the management looks into it. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rishi Agarwal | 1632482 | 4.5 | 2016-12-10 17:02:43 | On the 9th floor at Fort Knox, the newly opened Monkey Bar is a beautiful place to visit. The place offers an unmatched view of the city and the interiors and a class apart which make it one step ahead of other places in the city.
The food on offer is delicious. The mushrooms I ordered and the chilli cheese dragons are a must try for all.
Overall a great new place to visit with a great atmosphere and very polite attendants. |
 
Monkey Bar | TraveKings | 29893242 | 4.5 | 2016-12-07 13:14:55 | Located at Fort Knox. It is like Social in Delhi. Good Ambience. Maintaining a Good Standard. Decent Crowd. Decent Hookah & Decent Food. Good Service.¬†2 big screen to enjoy live sports .¬†Little expensive. It will cost around Rs.3000 for 2 person.A Good place to hangout with friends. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sukanya Ghosh | 589490 | 3.5 | 2016-12-04 21:24:11 | This one is new in Kolkata, and is definitely pulling lot of crowd. I went there on a Friday evening with two of my friends and it was full of people. Located in camac street, near Urban Desi, not too difficult to locate. The moment you step in , the first thing you notice are the big french windows with a view to die for :), Howrah Bridge and Victoria Memorial at the same, who would not love that!¬†
Now coming to the food, its nothing extraordinary, very mediocre tasting with prices on the higher side. We ordered for 1 mix mushroom bruschetta, mushroom and truffle oil pizza, and tikki of joy (fish). The bruschetta and the pizza was very ordinary, bland in taste I would say. Tikki of joy was definitely good with very subtle flavours, perfectly cooked to perfection.
My rating is truly for the ambience and the fish, anyway one could always try out this place¬†
Thumbs up for the view :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Gunjan Saraf | 33964908 | 4.5 | 2016-12-03 14:49:16 | My visit to this place raised my bar of expectations from kolkatas nightlife.. Posh crowd, sophisticated ambience, soothing music, projector screen for matches, good food and superb hukka! The place has it all. We ordered for lebanese platter and cheese spring rolls, both finger licking good! The capuccino cofee was average but the hukka made up for it! A must visit for all the crazy kolkatans looking for a break from chai break! |
 
Monkey Bar | Subham Agarwal | 777244 | 1.0 | 2016-12-01 13:05:10 | THIS PLACE IS PATHETIC

I ATE THE PANEER KHICHDI AND I AND MY FRIEND BOTH ¬†HAD A TERRIBLE INFECTION AFTER HAVING THIS. I THINK THEIR COOKING STANDARDS ARE VERY LOW.

WHEN I CALLED THEM TO SAY THAT I HAD A TERRIBLE INFECTION AFTER HAVING YOUR FOOD THEY ¬†HAD NO ANSWER.

I HAVE ALSO PUT UP A COMPLAIN AT FOOD AND QUALITY STANDARDS DEPARTMENT AGAINST THEM,

I SUGGEST NO ONE SHOULD GO THERE AT ALL. |
 
Monkey Bar | Risshe Malhotra | 31063007 | 4.5 | 2016-11-29 22:39:12 | Amazing food lovely ambience, joy is one of the best ppl he makes you feel special and the service is out of the world. Centrally located... |

Monkey Bar | Kirti Agarwal | 16014301 | 3.0 | 2016-11-28 15:30:12 | I think it is one of the over rated places..the service was ok..music was very sad n sheesha not dat great...although ambience was good..but such a brand it is..der is an expectation bar which it disappoints to a great extent. |
 
Monkey Bar | Amrita Ghosh | 33949647 | 4.0 | 2016-11-26 20:51:37 | Want to dine with a view of Victoria memorial, step in here, which interiors n amazing food, gud classics as music and a lovely crowd, one cn spend hours here dining n wining. Food: chicken nachos is a good quantity. Mediterranean platter a lovly combo of flavors n great taste. Pizzas are thin crust n perfect. Drinks are innovative, I tried mamas girl & mojitos. Its one a litl higher side on the pocket but not exorbitant. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sanjiv Sood | 186102 | 4.5 | 2016-11-26 07:39:01 | The ‚ÄòMonkey Bar‚Äô Kolkata Avatar is a welcome addition to it's watering hole map and what an experience it metes out! Located in the heart of the city (Camac Street) with a huge and lofty space, it exudes a comfort zone feel. The visual delight of the interior space couples well with a spectacular view of the Kolkata skyline from the restaurant.¬†

The cream de la cr√®me among the restaurant‚Äôs USP's is the outdoor seating arrangement of about 5-6 tables. Although open to air, yet it is air-conditioned to beat the muggier months. Incidentally during the clement months it would be a pronounced experience to soak in Kolkata‚Äôs mild winters. The corner verandah serves hookah for the y-generation and for those who love to smoke with their tipple it is a rather comfortable space. I loved the incipient November chill all through the evening in the outdoor! It would be an idyllic place all through the wintery months to soak in the chilled weather.

Though I am not a cocktail loving person, I ventured out to try some of their swinging concoctions. First shot was the famed Manga.

Sweet and Tangy Vodka based cocktail, it had an all desi flavour burst from the Aam Panna as the main base with its signature cumin flavour to follow. It comes in a kullar shaped glass with etched in a typical Hinglish font that sets the tone for a fusion evening. 
Next, was the more stylized ‚ÄòMad Men‚Äô a Bourbon base with Coffee Orange and a whiff of Rosemary spray, which, I really liked and got myself a double dose.

 
 

Getting headier, I tried out the Copper Monkey, lo and behold but predictably it was in a copper mug. I quite liked the passion fruit flavour and the hint of mint in it worked well.

¬†

Although christened as ‚ÄòMonkey Bar‚Äô one would be rather surprised to see a super array of fusion food alongwith some very innovative desi leaning twisters. One look at the menu and I was instantly attracted to the Laal Maas Phulka Tacos, Radish cake bites for its novelty, Mobar Caramelized Pork ribs for its slow cooking and the Butterfly Chicken for the signature shells. 
The Laal Maas in the Phulka Tacos was juicy and well done, served on a ¬†Bao Stand for appeal as well as to function as a 'hold on'.  The meat was unique in flavour and spiced up enough to support its Laal Maas Status! 

 

The radish /mooli cake bites were indeed a experience though one really cannot make out if radish is used as the main filling ingredient unless told. The Tempura batter and the black bean sauce make up for the frunchy bite and flavour of the Radish bites.

 

The caramelized rib was succulent and smokey, living up the 6-hour slow cooked traditional method. So was it's house sauce quite zesty and lip smacking. 

 

The Butterfly Chicken was perhaps the only dish, which I would give the pass, though a visual delight again. I was lead to believe or was expecting a Butter Chicken filling. Maybe that is a good idea too.

Overall this place is not all just ambience, though that feeling is certainly overwhelming and sets up the mood. The service, food and the liquid chemistry in the cocktails are commendable too.

Monkey Bar | Kaustav Nayak | 1276373 | 5.0 | 2016-11-25 09:43:48 | With its French windows giving a glimpse of both the Victoria Memorial as well as the Howrah Bridge, the ambient lighting, great music, brick walls, a gorgeous skylight, a section that projects black and white motion picture and an apparently messy but ultimately symmetric seating arrangement that will please the OCD in you, Monkey Bar is hands down the best looking place in town. The ambiance, crowd and the location itself (9th floor of the Fort Knox building in Camac Street) itself demands a high rating. But it outdoes itself in the food department as well.¬†

The tiger beef is an instant classic. Perfectly cooked and just the right amount oily, this is a dish that I will highly recommend. The chettinad chicken samosas on the other hand flattered to deceive, definitely not worth the high price. Reddy's chicken popcorn though is a whole different story : small pieces of chicken fried with curry leaves, ¬†sesame, coconut shreds and a concoction of south Indian spices.¬†The name that will pique your interest however is the butter chicken khichudi. Bengali style sticky rice cooked amalgamated with Punjabi style chicken butter masala, this is a dish that has sharp flavors very well attuned for the Indian tongue. I absolutely loved it! 4 small cups containing curd, ghee, pickle and papad are given as accompaniments.¬†
¬†

And just everything else, their dessert section is more than competent too. While the snicker bar with its milk chocolate ganache on a crunchy almond base and a chocolate cake below may feel a tad too sweet, they provide a coffee ice cream to go with it and together the balance is delectable. The gondhoraj lime tart was more in my wheelhouse : the tangy lime curd really stood out. If I have to recommend one among these two I'd say take a leap of faith, ditch the always reliable chocolate and go for the tart.¬†

Here's to next time. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pratik Sensarma | 10848301 | 5.0 | 2016-11-22 20:50:17 | A too good place to b with your friends...had been there some days before...services are good...and ambience... Wat a place... After a long time had been to such an awesome place like this... One could have a marvelous view of the city Kolkata... Specially our Victoria memorial and cathedral Church...the foods are very tasty ...starting from Manga , tiger beef, tikki of joye to other cocktails  everything was perfectly made and served. Then lastly the desserts...the chocolate cake mainly... Was the best... Really had an too good time..keep it up guys  :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Anusreea Paul | 2257306 | 4.5 | 2016-11-21 12:13:39 | The famous brand is finally here in Kolkata. It's been three months since they opened doors on Camac Street and there's been no looking back for them :)
Had the opportunity to visit the place thanks to a bloggers meet. This is the brain child of chef Manu Chandra, the team, the food is crafted by him. The place epitomizes awesomeness in every inch. The place is big, read huge!! The huge old school windows lead you to stare at the city landscape with wide open eyes. They have an open seating arena, high rise chairs and comfortable sofas to choose from. They serve alcohol and hookah. They even arrange for sundowners on wintry afternoons, for you to sip on their lavish cocktails and enjoy the sun going down. The Victoria Memorial and the Howrah bridge are visual delights. They have their pub rules hence it is better to read them up and visit!
The crafted menu for the afternoon:

**Drinks**

Copper Monkey: Served in a copper vessel with a ¬†chunk of orange came this cocktail, whiskey based.

Manga: The ever famous drink, vodka based, a concoct of vodka and mango pulp.

Hipster Smash: Smacking name, and a refreshing drink! The array of colors are incredible. Mix of watermelon juice, a huge chunk of frozen watermelon and vodka.

Old Fashioned on Camac: The name might sound synonymous with rum but it is a whiskey based cocktail.

**Food**

Kerala Red Rice: A vegetarian and a non-vegetarians' delight! Thick red rice mixed with southern spices. It's spicy, it's crunchy, and it's tangy!!

Tiger Beef: The best, best, best beef is served here!! A bowlful of spicy meaty delight!! The shredded, well cooked, perfectly spiced beef served as the best chakna with the cocktails. Quite filling, good in quantity. Must order and highly recommended.

Butterfly Chicken: The outer coatings are designed like butterflies. Fried to perfection, oil less, the butterfly winged shaped cups are visual delights. Filled inside the cups are shredded chicken mixed in a nice sauce. Recommended for the sheer taste, intensity of the dish, and the efforts behind the perfect butterfly wings!

Shammi Sliders: These little burgers are lovely to look at. They do not fill you up completely yet leave you quite satisfied. The minced meat patties are perfect and there's no saucy drips. You actually do not mess yourself up eating this. Accompanied with some house special fries served inside a cute monkey bar wrapper.

Tikki of Joy: Quite a big hit down south, they decided to include it in their Kolkata menu as well. Huge chunks of bhetki frie to perfection. Served with onion rings and mint chutney. Crispy, ample fish in every mouthful, not oily at all.

Lal Maas Phulka Tacos: even sized parathas half rolled like rolls, filled with minced juicy meat. The meat is tender and you would feel like you are eating a roll, Kolkata style!!

**Desserts**

Gondhoraj Lime Tart: Tad a bit too bitter if eaten without the entire chunk. The idea is take a bit of the biscuit base, the creme, the lemon curd, the pistachio cake, and the raspberry sugared petals. And you could keep eating that and stare into the dreamy wintry sky line. But make sure to get a window seat..:)

Old Monkey Signature Chocolate Cake: What is a chocolate if it does not make you high!!! Well, this one sure does...a huge chunk of chocolate bar sprinkled with praline and caramel sauce. Served with a little scoop of ice cream...aaahhh never felt better!!¬†

Guys, agar aap Monkey Bar nahi gaye to please jaldi jaiye...it's waiting for you!! The coolest place in town to rock and roll. Try their karaoke nights or their usual dining hours, you will not be disappointing!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Suruchi Bhawsinghka | 1140387 | 3.0 | 2016-11-21 09:59:22 | The amount of tax,service charge vat, and wat not they are adding is insane.I have been to so many resto ,trust me this place is not worth it.I would rather sit in a five-star hotel lounge to spend around 5k between 4 ppl. If you leave aside the taxes you would always want to visit this place .Loved d simple decor(specially the huge windows ) perfect place to chill with friends and enjoy your drink.Snacks are average .Guys pls check ur taxes ...u r being unreasonable !!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Prarthana Roy | 1683183 | 3.5 | 2016-11-20 21:42:56 | Firstly , very much overpriced ! But fell in love with their decor and view .. food is overpriced according to their portion and most importantly they don't taste sound to be priced that much ! And coming to tax .. 1000 bucks ?! U will surely be left with a whole in ur pocket .. recommended for once , strictly ! |

Monkey Bar | Dhawal Pratap SIngh | 442772 | 3.5 | 2016-11-14 14:34:01 | The place has excellent ambience and definitely scores well on the food quality. However, the portions are really small adding on to the already heavy cost. Instead of 1500 for 2, its a place where you will incur Rs1500 per person. Plus the taxes are a lot on the pocket. Our regular bill of Rs 4800 had Rs2000 worth of taxes amounting to a total of Rs 6800! Paying 40% tax on top of my bill is not something I was looking forward to. |
 
Monkey Bar | Supriya Baid | 34842096 | 5.0 | 2016-11-13 20:55:15 | One of the best ambience i have ever seem in kolkata! Fabulous üëå great crowd. Good servers. Well maintained. Lovely presentation of food. Hookah love üíï keep it up guys ‚úå |
 
Monkey Bar | Shruti Keshri | 12428511 | 1.0 | 2016-11-08 22:26:50 | Pathetic place, the food quantity is so less, waiters don't understand anything, once you order the order only comes when you die hungry. We waited for  bill for almost 14 mins and then left, the waiter came running out to get the bill, and top of that the bill was wrong, they charged us for we didn't order also.

Over priced, lazy, pathetic place. Never visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | The Calcutta Foodie | 36569739 | 4.5 | 2016-11-08 11:14:50 | Monkey bar is the newest attraction in town and rightly so, talking about interiors the biggest hit is the huge Windows showing the skyline of Calcutta, it's a breathtaking view from the 9th floor. 

The menu is quite innovative and the concoctions in terms of the cocktails are pretty darn good.

The food doesn't disappoint at all the butterfly chicken was crispy and juicy which is very rare a combination and the pork ribs had a smokey barbecue flavour to them and were very, very soft. 

The place is slightly expensive, but, with that ambience and quality, it's hardly an issue. |
 
Monkey Bar | Ms_WalkingShoes | 1193155 | 4.5 | 2016-11-07 18:24:29 | Read d reviews on Zomato n planned to pop over to dis place.
The interiors..ambience...music..crowd n d staff is absolutely perfect.
The view is jus mindblowing n d breeze is so soothing.
We ordered Prawn Pil Pil which was yum..
The Beef Pickle and the Pork Sausages were a bit disappointing.
We had two beers and a virgin mojito.
D thing dat was bit disappointing was dat our bill was 2368Rs...out of which 535Rs was jus all kinda tax.
Overall this place is one of d best plc to hangout around. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rishav Dey | 193398 | 4.0 | 2016-11-07 14:01:53 | Six of us landed up at Monkey Bar on a Saturday evening. It was a nightlife hotspot at 19:30 hours already and we had to wait almost 40 minutes before we could be seated. We were ushered in and given the offer of crowding around the bar which we accepted.
The ambiance was great. Music was good and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Making a conversation wasn't the easiest thing to do but at places like this that is quite expected. 
We kicked off the evening with a portion of Loaded Nachos, 4 helpings of Pack a Punch, one Old Fashioned on Camac with bourbon and one Mama's Girl with Absolut. The last two we had to settle for because Toast to Calcutta couldn't me made due to lack of availability of gin. The nachos were appetizing and I liked my old fashioned with bourbon but the accompanying almond biscotti was too sweet for me. The pack a punch was good but the Mama's Girl was not appreciated by any one.
The Aam Admi Eggs went down well with me. It reminded me of the bhel puri walas and their chutneys. The eggs were soft but firm. It made me crave a bit for the soft, gooey and runny yolk. The Hispter Smash was nice but the Tipsy Sherbet was quite interesting for me because I have always wondered how alcohol would blend with rose syrup and Mo Bar did a wonderful job. The Copper Monkey was a bit like a fruity mint julep but I did like it. The Not so Vanilla was not quite my kind of cocktail with the creamy texture so I exchanged that for the Hipster Smash with a friend. The best cocktail according to me was by far the Mad Men. All the flavours combined really well and complimented each other beautifully. Coffee and orange always work well but the subtle rosemary was a delightful addition. 
The duck pita pockets were great. Oriental flavours in between a pita was an unusual combination but the pita seemed to go quite well with the duck in five spice and the hoisin sauce. The Kerala Beef Fry was nice but I would have loved to have it with Malabar parotta instead of the bread they served. The smoked chicken pizza was decent too. 
The service was very good. There was a period in between when we were very unhappy with the excruciatingly slow service but our server was extremely apologetic about it and cited the reason of a busy weekend evening for the barmen. It was understandable as far as I was concerned. The value for money is perhaps a bit on the lower side and I would say Mo Bar is a moderately expensive place. The food was mostly good. The drinks too were mostly very good. And I couldn't get enough of the Mad Men. So I will return for the Mad Men and to try the beef bulgogi, tiger beef, Goan chrizo pav, baked brie and prawn ghee roast. Recommended if one doesn't mind spending a bit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sharan Bansal | 394157 | 5.0 | 2016-11-06 18:14:14 | Amazing new York style ambience in Kolkata. Great hospitality and service! We had an awesome Sunday lunch with friends over champagne , rum punch and beer ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sahil Islam | 1001945 | 5.0 | 2016-11-05 00:53:16 | Lovely place with nice decor ...... The pricing was excellent given the quality of the food even for non drinkers it is a not to be missed spot loved the duck pita pocket and snicker bar |
 
Monkey Bar | Harsh Agarwal | 615445 | 4.5 | 2016-11-03 22:40:49 | Food, decor and ambience is top notch. Kolkata has got a Gem restaurant and bar. The view and seating is made for each other.

For the egg lovers-"Aam aadmi eggs. Sheer brilliant dish. Must try if you visit.

The staff needs to be a little polite and polished. Lack hospitality and softness. If they can improve upon this, it will be no doubt the finest joint in the city.

Will surely visit again. |
 
Monkey Bar | Santanu Adhikary | 31601287 | 4.5 | 2016-11-02 15:01:09 | Awesome ambience. ..mesmerising view of our beloved quintessential kolkata. ..love the taste of butterfly chicken and nachos with whisky. .. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul | 20537314 | 4.0 | 2016-10-31 13:45:15 | Great food, smooth shisha and pleasant staff at a great location. The food served was fresh and tasty. Though the open area for shisha is a little congested. This is a perfect alternative to bar exchange since the staff is very pleasant. Had an outing with 8 of team mates on October 25, costed 7.5 k excluding alcohol. Will be my preferred location for after work outings as long as the staff is pleasant. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pooja Marwaha | 1981882 | 4.0 | 2016-10-30 23:11:30 | One of the new places opened in Calcutta. This place has a great view of the city with good music. When I say good music, I mean music in the background and you can hear the person sitting opposite to you. The service is spot on. The servers attend to you first and do not chit chat in a corner. Now the food, ordered a farmers pizza which was good enough for an evening snack. The best thing that happened during the evening was the hookah. It was so smooth yet gave the kick. After a very long had really good hookah. The price pinch is moderate too. Would definitely visit more often now. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Agrawal | 1902980 | 4.5 | 2016-10-30 00:43:02 | Since its opening, have been there couple of times already. The evening view of the city is definitely one of the the ups of the place.¬†
The ambience is awesome and the right kind of classy touch interiors makes you want to come n relax with friends.¬†
The mocktails were good, and some dishes mentioning special mention are Chilli Cheese dragons, Med platter, Falafel Sliders and Mobar Laksa.¬†
Thanks Avantika for bringing the Monkey to town. :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Divya Khettry | 1930204 | 4.0 | 2016-10-29 12:09:30 | Finally the Monkey swings East! Must day amazing ambience and view. Drinks were great too the only thing I didn't like here was the food its a little average. I also loved the music all my fav tracks were played. |
 
Monkey Bar | Tushar Goyal | 1881622 | 4.5 | 2016-10-29 10:47:35 | Unluckily I ended up to the place on a Thursday and it was a dry day there, but the food was phenomenal . The moment you see the menu you want to try everything .

We ordered loaded nacho was very good , beet and orange salad which was ok , kimchi baby potatoes is a must try.
For the mains I ordered paneer kichdi which was good and the soulful bowl chilly paneer was good too. 

Going to go again for the non- veg very soon . |
 
Monkey Bar | Komal Agarwal | 34017613 | 3.5 | 2016-10-27 19:38:37 | The only good part about this place was the ambience and picturesque settings. Food is nothing worth mentioning. The spaghetti pasta was bad. Spring rolls & nachos were okay. Among the drinks, I really liked the Virgin Mangaa. |

Monkey Bar | Chandramouli Daga | 15803042 | 4.0 | 2016-10-24 20:41:36 | A sensational space with a terrific view of the Calcutta skyline. While it is expensive and the cocktails might not cater to everyone, the food is experimantally delicious while the service is admirable. 

Happening! And how! |
 
Monkey Bar | Moumita Das Talukdar | 343640 | 4.0 | 2016-10-24 20:01:03 | Visited this place at Fort Knox building 9th floor- the new outlet to party with friends. Gorgeous interiors and a stellar reputation as a chain we went there with high expectations and we were satisfied.Spectacular view with good music and awsum food. Innovative cocktails , lipsmacking pork and beef dishes.A must try joint. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anurag Jaiswal | 1778047 | 4.5 | 2016-10-24 18:14:19 | Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox building. The food & service are excellent. Ambiance is awesome. Per pax-Rs.1000 with drinks (inclusive of taxes) |
 
Monkey Bar | Sanjay Bhowmik | 29528004 | 4.0 | 2016-10-23 23:36:21 | I think I would rate this place 95% purely for the ambience and the view....the truly quintessential bar and cafe where you can have an awesome conversation at an awesome side table with an awesome view of the metropolis named Kolkata that I am yet to see anywhere in this city....truth be told, I was bedazzled and enamoured by the view....a whole 6/5!!!

Then comes the hard reality....for the few drinks (7), couple of coffee and a few bites, it was almost ‚Çπ4.2k....time to pay for the view!!!!....maybe a tinge more so 3.5/5....but the few hours spent are worth sitting there provided the company / conversation is good....

Nothing to write home about the food taste, just an avg 3.5/5

In the evening they have a good lighting set up and inspite of the crowd, every table and it's occupants had their own space and not intruded upon....it didn't feel cluttered like other such hallmark Kolkatan joints....would have gone for a 4.5/5 but they totally managed to screw that up with thumping music, which could have been easily done through the softer and low volume lounge music!!!...killed the evening ambience....if the idea was to attract the vibrant gen then they missed the fact that there were a whole lot of couples and a few bunch who were engrossed in their own conversation and seemed a bit irritated with the thumping bass....so here's a 3/5 for ruining the awesome layout and view....

If I would ever come again, it would be for the view and the window seats....but guys, do get some class in the music, the environment should provide for individual space, the layout, lighting, setting and ambience are awesome but your music settings are truly questionable, at least this time round!!! |

Monkey Bar | Sunanda Ghosh | 2720210 | 4.0 | 2016-10-20 12:21:51 | The newest addition to Camac Street, Monkey bar holds the promise of becoming one of the coolest hangouts for GenY. Situated on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building, it offers a panoramic view of the city through huge glass windows and what's more there's even arrangement for outdoor seating. The decor is charming and an awesome background score makes the ambience perfect for chilling out with your friends over great food and drinks. Firstly we ordered a butterfly chicken and duck pita pockets. The chicken was delicious and crispy tossed with bell peppers, chilli flakes and stuffed in crunchy butterfly shells and the duck meat marinated with spices and packed inside soft pita bread created fireworks in our mouths. We also went for a smoked chicken, chicken salami and harissa pizza which was superb, to say the least. There was another Hearty bowl, a heartwarming chicken broth with bean sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, flat noodles and bokchoy sprinkled with chilli oil. We finished off with Mobar Sundae Sandwich, an ice cream cake with nuts layered with nutella and tutti fruti. We also tried their hookah and the shisha is really good and strong. The service is more of less..efficient and the staff polite..but the pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side. They recently acquired their bar license, so would love to drop in again for a taste of their cocktails! |
 
Monkey Bar | Pamela Nandi | 2821382 | 3.0 | 2016-10-20 01:06:16 | No doubt this place has an amazing ambience with an indoor and outdoor seating area styled in the form of british pub, but food and service is very very poor.¬† We went on ashtami night with friends, they took about an hour to prepare the chicken stacked as saslik to grill it. Once served, the dish was just tasteless. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sunrita Sarkar | 804376 | 5.0 | 2016-10-18 22:44:36 | Hi, if you love Calcutta , good music(and by good music I mean led zeppelin and pink flyod and classics as such ) and a brilliant view of Calcutta, this is the place to be. 

We ordered a pack up punch, Sangria and a 100 pipers based cocktail. All three were pretty different and pretty well made. 

We didn't order any food as we were so engrossed in the decor and view. 

The hospitality was brilliant. 

Do give it a visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Aritra Roy | 145459 | 4.5 | 2016-10-17 22:31:23 | Already visited twice in such a short span of opening its doors in Kolkata, Monkey Bar has been fabulous on both occasions. Situated on the top floor of Fort Knox, it provides a magnificent view of the Kolkata skyline with Victoria Memorial, St Pauls Cathedral, Hooghly bridge and the 42 which is the tallest building here.

The food has been great and is presented in a unique way. Ordered Chilli Cheese dragons, Mac and cheese croquettes, Butterfly chicken and Chicken Chimichurri on the first time along with Mangaa mocktail. On the repeat, we ordered Mobar caramel ribs, Tiger beef, Reddys popcorn chicken alongwith a Smoked chicken pizza. In drinks, we had copper monkey , house made ginger beer with a couple of KF ultras.

However special mention must go to the desserts, Snicker bar is just too good while Nolen gur creme brulee was delicious.
They have a small open air area for hookah as well. The service is prompt and the ambience is quite relaxing. The bar looks pretty while the music changes over time with comforting tracks during evening to partying ones as the night progresses on.

Overall, the Kolkata gastropub scene is proud to have Monkey bar in its lineup. Hope it gets better from here.Cant wait to visit soon again :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Rupsha Bhadra | 606325 | 4.5 | 2016-10-16 14:33:22 | Monkey bar in Delhi is a location that is a part of some very special memories so I had really high expectations from its Calcutta counterpart. It certainly did not disappoint. We ordered loaded chicken nachos, the butter chicken kichdi, smoked chicken pizza and others. The butter chicken khichdi was really impressive. So were the cocktails Maanga and Copper monkey. A little on the higher side when it comes to the pocket pinch, monkey bar did live up to all the expectations. And the view is just fantastic. |
 
Monkey Bar | Madhurya Sarkar | 6309371 | 5.0 | 2016-10-16 12:11:35 | Just loved it.
The ambiance, the playlist, the skyline view, the staff management, the food and everything is just superb of this pub. This is located in the 9th floor of Knox building opposite to Urban desi. We visited late afternoon but the best time would be to hit this place in the evening. This can be an ideal place to go a date with your partner :)
The view of St. Paul's Cathedral, Victoria Memorial and Hooghly Bridge adds flavour to their ambiance.
Coming to food we had kingfisher premium beer, chicken wings and chocolate lava cake. All of the dishes were value for money. Overall had an excellent experience.
Coming back soon :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Syed Murtaza Jafar | 32607152 | 5.0 | 2016-10-16 04:52:57 | Ok, so same night we visited The Great Booze Story and Monkey Bar, and I'll say Monkey Bar won big time. Just opposite Urban Desi (will visit soon), good collection of music, courteous and attentive staff, this is one venue that you would want to visit again. The ambience, the view of the The Victoria Memorial is just a sight to look at. Safe to say, I'll be coming back to this place soon |
 
Monkey Bar | Preity | 27451267 | 4.5 | 2016-10-15 21:30:28 | Rare does it happen that you get good food at a bar and by the ambience of this place i expected nothing different..but to my surprise it was a very delightful experience..superbbbb food..good music, not too loud so you can chit chat with your friends..and very courteous staff..overall a very good experience..definitely coming back and soon... |

Monkey Bar | Rashmi Adhikary | 31014016 | 4.5 | 2016-10-14 14:26:12 | We visited Monkey Bar on Saptami evening, and had a spectacular time. The ambience is lively, the music is great, the decor very impressive and the service commendable.  
Now coming to the sumptuous meal; an assortment of drinks - whiskey, tequila, rum, virgin mojita, espresso -  was ordered with starters being Butterfly Chicken and Chicken Chapli. Yes, Butterfly Chicken is a definitely worth a try. In the main course, there was Aunty Vinnie's Berry Pulao. Tiger Beef was so delicious that two more dishes were ordered; this is must-try for beef lovers. This is the first place in Kolkata that I see so many beef dishes being offered. Galouti Killer was the other beef dish ordered and equally palatable. I had Mee Goreng which is an Indonesian dish of spiced noodles and got it topped with chicken. 
Overall, it was a great experience in this newly-opened gastropub. |
 
Monkey Bar | Piyush Dalmia | 15726652 | 4.5 | 2016-10-13 20:42:49 | Another fab newbie in the city

Talk about the Ambience, Food, Service or the Decor, it excels in all

Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building at Camac Street, it offers a spectacular view of the city
 
The Decor and Seating Arrangements are well made 

They got a separate smoking area which is quite airy, and has ample seating space as well

Shisha was pretty decent and lasted quite a while

Now lets talk about the protagonist here

Nachos were crisp and loaded with cheese, the Platter was appealing and featured variety of items whereas the mocktails were on fleek 

But things which really caught our attention were Spaghetti and Paneer Khidchi

While the former was extremely tasty, the latter is a MUST have dish for sure

All in all, it was a happy dining experience for us |
 
Monkey Bar | Arpita Agarwal | 998579 | 4.5 | 2016-10-13 12:39:47 | A new place in town, much awaited. Great ambience! The view is also super!! Maybe they should have had a slightly larger rooftop area. Food is decent too. The nachos were pretty good. The Manga is a must try!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sharmistha Mukherjee | 722185 | 4.5 | 2016-10-12 06:49:58 | If you are in Calcutta and love the skyline and a few drinks to go along with it on a hot, rainy or crisp evening this is the place to be. Monkey Bar in Calcutta is done up beautifully and affords you a view of the Victoria Memorial, St Paul's Cathedral and the Hoogly Bridge. The have cocktails and food over and above what they offer in other cities. The hipster smash is delicious to say the least. As was the bourbon cocktail with almond bitters... |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohit Suryawanshi | 36318376 | 5.0 | 2016-10-11 18:11:29 | My favourite lalmass Takos ,Pizza and Delicious Chillie cheese Dragon.
The friendliness of the staff seems genuine. I have never seen such good customer service as I experienced. |
 
Monkey Bar | FOODBUFFS | 987893 | 4.0 | 2016-10-11 11:16:14 | Visited on Ashtami night.Even though it was a good crowd,we managed to get a table immediately,courtesy to the experienced and efficient management team.There is an open-air seating which mainly caters to people ordering hookah or going there for a puff.Indoor seating is quite large.
Decor is akin to a British pub.Upholstery is comfortable.What allures you are those French windows through which you can catch a great glimpse of the city skyline,from the ninth floor.In the evenings there is muted lighting.Ambience is quite good.We heard some good old day soft music but as the night grew,the DJ started giving groovy yet classy numbers.
Service is warm and polite but there was a lack of professionalism.We were giving the same food order to two or three different men at times.The servers,even though quite courteous,were not quite clearly conversant about the food and beverages,unless asked upon.Details or any recommendations/suggestions were not given on their own.They need to more vocal  and well informed about every detail of the food when the order is being placed.
PAN RASNA HOOKAH-strong flavour,no choking but the smoke was quite weak,unlike to our liking.It was smooth but the smoke didnot last for an hour.It wasnot worth the price charged.Not satisfied.
BUTTERFLY CHICKEN-tastewise quite impressive.Chicken morsels were soft and had a sweet tangy taste.The sauce was pretty good and spicy and the butterfly shells were crispy,the whole presentation looked lovely.Three butterflies were there.
REDDY'S CHICKEN POPCORN-Well this dish took us to South India.Moderately sized chicken morsels deep fried in a batter having a crisp crunchy texture and the taste was so consistent in southern flavours,it tasted good.Curry leaves flavour was predominant and we liked it a lot to go for a second order.
CHICKEN CHIMICHURI-Chicken was soft.They were skewed up but the flavours were quite bland,didnot stand up to our expectations.Not impressive at all,this dish needs improvement.
MEDITERRANEAN PLATTER-Mixed comments.It was great in some parts,not so great in others.Chickpea fries were not so good to taste,seemed a bit too fried where the chickpea stuffing was too less.The pita breads were nice,soft,fluffy,buttered and nicely grilled,tasted good.Hummus was in great quantity,tastewise perfect but the babaghanoush didnot stand out in taste.Cheese filo wraps tasted good.They  had soft spinach with gooey cheese inside wrapped in rice papers and fried.Overall a good dish,you can give it a try if Mediterranean cuisine is your calling.
OLD MONK(EY) CHOCOLATE CAKE-Good.Cake was melt in mouth soft and creamy.Consistency of cream was smooth,light and fluffy.The dessert was classy,superb and hence recommended.
Foodwise we were not that satisfied as much as we were with their cocktails!!
Their BOURBON LIIT,MAD MEN and MAMA'S GIRL were just bang on!The bartender did a great job.The blend was great,the liquor gave a great kick,courtesy the good mixing.They were well balanced in flavours and the ingredients of the drinks very well complimented each other.Spices and mint went well with vodka,and coffee with whisky surely made a great pair.
We also ordered Heineken,Ginger ale and fresh lime soda which was usual.
As far as price is concerned,it is too high for the food and some cocktails! Quantity of food is very less,so doesnot justify the price and tastewise it didnot make a good mark.The cocktails had a price tag which was same as most gastropubs having a good establishment cost,yet they were high.
This pub is a must visit,esp for their awsome cocktails.The gastronome part needs improvement to call it a fair gastropub.Will visit again for sure owing to the overall good experience that we had,a good hangout place and to try other cocktails and entr√©es. |

Monkey Bar | Sreyashi M. | 10853321 | 4.5 | 2016-10-09 19:05:16 | Visited today for lunch, and a had a lovely time! 
I suggest you get a table by the windows. The Kolkata skyline will definitely make your visit even more memorable. 
We tried the Maanga cocktail (5 stars, peeps!) with the Tiger Beef. I suggest you try both. Succulent meat with the zing of your drink makes for some very happy (read: tipsy) people. 
For mains, we tried the Mobar burger and it was heavenly! The Naga pork soulful bowl was fabulous too! Portions are great, flavour is gorgeous and staff is super sweet and nice. 
I hope you maintain what you've got going so I can visit again! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sudipto Mitra | 2401672 | 3.5 | 2016-10-09 09:00:39 | Nice decor , awsum view of the cityscape and great cocktails . Food is good to average with a twist and may not be liked by all.
We ordered pitchers of pack a punch,mangaa amd mohjito and the first is the best.

We stuck with finger food only and ordered 
Mushroom bruschetta(good),prawn pil pil(gr8), chicken churi(avg) and tiger beef(gr8)
Rounded everything off with aunty berry pulao which was delicious
 This a typical gastro bar with foot tapping music which is too loud at times, we had to ask it to be turned down.

The service could have been bettet and there  was confusion while seating. We were waiting at the bar for our table to be ready but some other guests jumped on that

Oh forgot to mention a outing here will surely burn a whole in your pocket |
 
Monkey Bar | Vedant Kabra | 2240676 | 4.5 | 2016-10-09 08:47:40 | I went to monkey bar last night and I was pretty surprised. Read all the reviews and thoroughly analysed the place in my mind before I went there (it's what I do). 
The guy at the front desk (I believe he was the owner) was phenomenal. So welcoming, so easy going and so 'approachable'. The one at the front desk is the face of any restaurant. He told us we'll have to wait for 40, but we got a table in 20. Told us we'll have to share the table - but eventually we didn't have to. 
I think seating right outside the kitchen + bar worked for us. Didn't have to wait for the food (the cheese drum, nachos and mushroom + truffle oil pizza are INSANE). Ordered quite a bit on the liquor front - barring the martini everything else was really good (fun presentation too!) (including the ginger beer). We had heard so much about the desserts - total let down though (chocolava cake with mint ice cream was terrible I must confess - Mezzuna gets the big ups here). 
The staff was pretty alright (looked a little confused at times). 
Monkey bar must work on guest management (but it is only a few weeks old so it's okay). Thoroughly impressed with the ambience (trumps Mezzuna and all the other hot spots in the city several times over), food, booze and service. 
This place has my highest recommendation. |
 
Monkey Bar | Argha Basu | 1892606 | 5.0 | 2016-10-08 15:46:45 | If you want to impress your girlfriend or wife . Just take her there . Take your seat next to the glass wall and enjoy the panaromic view of the Victoria memorial, Vidyasagar Setu and the Howrah Bridge.

Monkey Bar | Puja Das | 36272619 | 4.5 | 2016-10-08 12:52:12 | Bookmarks . ¬†It's got an amazing atmosphere with outdoor and indoor seating. Despite going on the weekend it gets the right amount of crowd that makes it a very happening place. Music was really good. We wanted to try a new cocktail, so we went for the ¬†toast to calcutta which was a little different and tasted quite good. Food on the other hand was quite unique. 
service is also impressed us. ¬† ¬†

The place is a little hard to find. But overall it's a nice place for the weekend chill! |
 
Monkey Bar | Tejash | 15384381 | 1.5 | 2016-10-08 11:33:48 | Visited this place on 7th October with friends. We were a group of 11 but there is no place for such big group there.  The table we were given was ideal for 7 but we had to squeeze in.  Repeated request for chair felt to deaf ears till such time my friend pulled up the bar chair from the adjacent table. They have limited staff and one server was alloted to the tables.  Needless to say the service was pathetic and totally unacceptable. Our order for beer and ginger ale took 30 mins and after repeated reminders it arrived.  The food is average with limited option for Vegetarian. No one wants to eat "baigan pakora " or " vada pav" at such a place.  We were charged for one item that was ordered but not served. On pointing the same the server "argued" that we didn't realise but it was indeed served to us.  In no mood to hang around any more we just paid and left.  While waiting down for our car we met others who too were very disappointed with the place. 

This will be one of those places in kolkata that will soon be ticked off based on word or mouth and customer experience because of shabby service and attitude of the people who run it. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anshuman Jalan | 31752408 | 2.0 | 2016-10-08 00:20:08 | Good atmoshpere ! Average food for vegie lovers ! Place to chill and soak in the music and buzz around . Nothing home to write about the food . And weekend and holidays . aVOID as unable to give service due to rush |
 
Monkey Bar | Darshana Rampuria | 2855224 | 3.5 | 2016-10-05 11:34:14 | So finally visited Monkey Bar ! The ambience is good as compared to What we get to see in Kolkata.. but apart from that nothing spectacular and surely cannot be compared to the one in Mumbai ! The food is Too average . We had ordered the Nachos - this one was a disaster , pesto spaghetti ( penne pasta wasn't there!!) - yet again very bland and just not up to the mark . Though tempura and mezze platter was good BUT the Coconut ice cream Dessert was FABULOUS SO an extra 0.50 points for that !! Food needs to be worked upon , staff is courteous ! Best wishes .. hoping my next visit be better and with no complains ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sujan Das | 36218418 | 4.5 | 2016-10-03 14:04:44 | I went this place with my friends and I would say this was amazing and was full packed in the weekend without liquor. There ambiance was very good and the music they place is also very nice . There drinks where also very good . They smoking and non smoking area also which was the best part of this place. Good place to spend with your friends. As we been to many other bars but I love this place as they have place to sit and there service was also excellent. They where pack but still there people know how to attend the gust which was very good in this bar. Pocket friendly and staff was excellent smiling and they working and they suggest also if you are new to this place and don't know what to order. I would suggest everyone for this place and sure you will be in love with this place. I basically tried everything on the menu (food and beverage), and yes it is all worth every penny
, I m fan of there menu and food, really enjoyed.¬†

Monkey Bar | Soul !! | 32140714 | 4.5 | 2016-10-03 08:50:51 | In a word, wonderful. We been to Delhi Monkey but this is the best one with wonderful view. 
One thing we really missed the Foosball) 
But no matter we had great time, fantastic food, we order lot many things forget the name but pizza and starters are yumm, drinks are also really nice
Staff were very welcoming too.

So keep good work guys !! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sarat | 8743511 | 3.0 | 2016-10-03 01:16:59 | ambience is good.. was excited to reach the place.. view n open air is also impressive.. u get a glimpse of the Victoria memorial
Although can't talk about the cocktails(coz we wet on 2nd oct, dry day), but we had the copper monkey mocktail and a ginger beer, we were very happy with both
But sadly food was extremely disappointing.. taste as well as quality is not upto the mark.. ordered the much talked about chicken butterfly, too sweet, no flavour of chicken n tasted Lyk beans on toast
Second ordered the spicy tomato spaghetti, worst I hav ever had, tasted like Maggi with tomato
Butter chicken khichadi was good,,, good innovation
Snickerbar, dessert, was well mind blowing if u hav a sweet tooth.. very nice and balanced taste
But the whole dining experience was not satisfactory |
 
Monkey Bar | Nikita Ramgarhia | 903737 | 2.5 | 2016-10-01 10:11:42 | An over hyped place.
The only plus points are the ambience and the service.
The hookah is average and food simply disappoints.
The vada pao is good.
The Mac and cheese croquettes have peas in them..like who does peas with cheese and Mac..
Too bad with the experimentation guys..
And the potato rackett is also very bland.
Galauti is average..
You guys are better in other cities I have heard..so pls improve in Kolkata |
 
Monkey Bar | Bindu | 36159071 | 3.5 | 2016-09-29 00:55:19 | At last chef manu chandra with his concept of monkey bar has entered in Kolkata.but sorry to say the food and service has dissapointed on comparison with the monkey bars in bombay and bangalore.
Need to check before its too late its my first experience but once more will love to try so that they can still improvise. |
 
Monkey Bar | Harish Todi | 1076456 | 2.0 | 2016-09-28 00:28:12 | The place is worst ever in all places that I do visit. What it seems from outside is not at all from inside. It's totally a different one and thats very disappointing for me. The hookah was so bad that I just left it after once. It was all a waste of money for me and that too a huge waste as it is very costly as per their brand name , but it's sad to say that it couldn't carry it'd brand name at all. |
 
Monkey Bar | Hardik Daga || Kolkata Epicurean | 9516701 | 4.0 | 2016-09-26 23:52:06 | Location-Fort knox building(9th floor),Camac street.

Finally "Monkey bar" has opened its gate to kolkata.After establishing itself in Mumbai,Delhi and Bangalore its opening in kolkata was much awaited.This place is totally a fresh take on gastrobar culture.As we entered we were totally astonished with the beauty of this place.The best part about this place was the swanky interiors and the dazzling view.The menu was mouthwatering and creation of one of the finest chef Manu Chandra.But along with whole lot of positive aspects this place has its negative side too and that is its service and price.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is extremely calm and soothing.The interiors are extremely high-toned.The place is divided into two sections(Smoking and Non Smoking area)which is appreciated.And atlast for this segment,we can bet that this place has the best view in comparison to any of the eateries in Kolkata.

Service-We were extremely disappointed with the service at this place.The staff was extremely confused with our seating.They took about 15 minutes to make us sit and also the table on which we were seated was already reserved by someone due to which we have to change our table in between.We also have to urge them many a times to serve us water and take the order for the food.But on the other side we saw that the staff was trained very well with the dishes and helped us to choose the right dishes according to our starvation.

Food-The food at this place was good in taste but what astonished us the most was their presentation,it was just praise-worthy.We had-
1:Med platter
2:Spicy panner bhurji buns
3:Chilli cheese dragons

Among them our favourite was "Med platter".We also had sheesha at this place which we find extremely expensive.It cost us around 800+taxes.

Food-4/5
Service-3/5
Ambiance-4.5/5

This place is a must visit for experiencing its Ambiance and food oresentation.üòÉüòÉ |
 
Monkey Bar | Ritwika Pal | 172912 | 4.0 | 2016-09-26 10:27:27 | Woo another gastropub in town, I was super excited to explore this new place. Unfortunately they not yet started with alcohol. But yes for compensation they have this Non alcoholic beer in their menu card. Which is more like a ginger ale.¬†
Food is awesome we tried Sticky Korean Chicken Wings and Prawn Pil Pil for which is can give 5/5. |
 
Monkey Bar | Manish Jhawar | 2238114 | 4.5 | 2016-09-26 00:59:53 | Different menu........v gud ambience.......gud view.........gud food!!
Nice place ... Shld visit...

Monkey Bar | Vikash Kumar Singh | 32056738 | 2.0 | 2016-09-25 23:21:32 | Went to this place on 25th of September. The best part of this hotel is the view of Victoria + Vidyasagar Setu. Food is ok types. Service needs to improve. Didnt like that much. |
 
Monkey Bar | Shakshi Bajaj | 34222951 | 4.0 | 2016-09-25 21:50:03 | Had recently visited the place.  Ambience was really good.  Soothing music and ample space worked well for me.  All the people were very courteous and response was very quick. We ordered nachos,  potato with rachlette cheese and pizza.  The food was yummmm. We asked for out of the menu toppings for pizza and they were more than happy to serve.  It was a pleasant experience. |
 
Monkey Bar | Samrat Banerjee | 984442 | 3.0 | 2016-09-25 18:48:36 | Visited the place on 24Sep. A mix of pro's and cons. Remarkably expensive, considering service is yet to reach premium standards. Yet to get a bar license, staff seems confused about where to seat you if you walk in as a couple. While the outdoor sitting layout is nice, it's primarily used as a hookah space by boisterous youngsters, and the seating layout is remarkably cramped. Service also is a minus here with the server not asking or serving water if not called to do so. Portions are quite small against the charges. Chicken Chimichuri was good, folks lovers which was 3 cutlets of bhekti coated and fried was ok. The mushroom pizza was definitely a let down. With 2 soft drinks the tab came to ‚Çπ1650+. Not worth a revisit soon. |
 
Monkey Bar | Abhishek Agarwal | 2897244 | 3.5 | 2016-09-25 03:13:53 | Was on the bucket list since it opened... So
We ordered a hookah but it failed my expectations... We tried out the tacos which was really nice... Service was on the slower side.... Definitely a lot to improve..
But then having ur food wit hookah nd Victoria memorial to look over.. The view is breathtaking..
But u need to live up to the name...
Hope to b back soon.... Nd wish to see a Better Trained Monkeyüëç |
 
Monkey Bar | Santosh Singhal | 27588565 | 5.0 | 2016-09-24 22:50:00 | An excellent place The sitting arrangement nice with a separate hukka place is very good 
The choice of menu is very good Everything is so so good & has a perfect taste According to me this is the first place where I did not have to add anything Desserts r very good Good Sevice Keep it upüëç |
 
Monkey Bar | Avijit Biswas | 1095896 | 4.5 | 2016-09-24 13:18:25 | Kolkata welcomes Monkey Bar with whole hearted love and appreciation... and they deserve it... no doubts about that...

Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox, Camac Street... and I will suggest everyone to go there during the evening... you guys will get mesmerized with the view of our City of Joy... I bet no other gustopub have such plus point till date in Kolkata... they have an excellent intero which you can enjoy anytime... also the outdoor seating is pretty attracting...

Monkey Bar | Shourya Sengupta | 2357486 | 4.5 | 2016-09-23 21:51:57 | Brilliant food! Loved the wide choice of meat. Please keep up the good work! Look forward to having the Galouti Killer, next time since it was not available. |
 
Monkey Bar | Siddhi Newatia | 3761881 | 3.0 | 2016-09-23 21:24:05 | Amazing ambience..very spacious, drinks menu could Hav had more variety..hated the mangaa drink..i found it too sour..the pizza and chilli cheese dragons were good. |
 
Monkey Bar | Harsh Bathwal | 1481844 | 3.5 | 2016-09-21 23:42:47 | Visited here for the first time. The food menu is different from what you come across usually in other restaurants. I think it's a perfect date spot as it has a beautiful Victoria building's view which looks amazing at night. Also the music was superb.
Pocket pinch : 600-700 per head. ( Food and mocktail) |
 
Monkey Bar | Shikha Ojha | 2112728 | 4.5 | 2016-09-18 01:48:05 | Amazing decor and awesome food. They had an outdoor sitting too which had a big screen playing Mickie and Minnie black and white cartoon synchronized with the songs being played. The cost is on the higher side but if you want to pamper yourself or people you love, this is the place to be. The amazing view is icing on the cake. |
 
Monkey Bar | Utsav Agarwal | 31137221 | 1.5 | 2016-09-17 22:49:13 | There is a difference in Bangalore wen it compares to Kolkata one , seriously don't no d reason but it needs to upgrade it very soon as in Bangalore. 
Specifically, the property is pretty old for a brand like dis 
According to me Monkey bar is just not another lounge but a more of a culture which in itself |
 
Monkey Bar | Arnav Jhunjhunwala | 22857974 | 5.0 | 2016-09-16 21:28:37 | The best place to hangout now. Food quality is excellent and many of the dishes aren't available anywhere in Kolkata. The key lime pie is unbelievable and a must have each time you go. |
 
Monkey Bar | Tanya Sen | 496614 | 5.0 | 2016-09-15 00:44:28 | The moment you walk in to this restaurant you're going to notice the long french windows and ofcourse the most beautiful view which includes victoria memorial. The ambience is lovely, very warm and urban. We ordered Aam Pannas, Tiger beef, Prawn Ghee Roast, Pepper Calamari. All of them were to die for. For dessert we ordered Nolen gurer creme br√ªl√©e. Yumm yumm!! I would totally come again. Loved itüòä |
 
Monkey Bar | Sourav Mukherjee | 306717 | 4.5 | 2016-09-14 11:38:19 | Finally they have arrived in Kolkata after rocking Delhi , Mumbai , Bangalore etc. and a few of Corporate Monkeys could muster the courage and had enough stock of lame excuses (for residential purposes only) to visit this joint on the lazy Saturday afternoon last week. Very conveniently located at Camac Street , innovative food & drinks menu like Kerala Rice , Butterfly Chicken , Prawn Pil Pil and many more.¬† Personally I loved the ginger beer. It was a full house and it is nice to see that City of Joy has lapped up the Monkey Bar and the legendary versatile gastronomical journey of Kolkata has just added yet another feather . Must visit joint for foodies and a great place to unwind. Wishing luck and Highly recommended !!!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Siddhartha Chowdhary | 211170 | 4.0 | 2016-09-14 00:31:42 | Dim lights and chic interiors. A totally fresh take on gastropub culture. The place was almost full when we entered so 9 of us had to accommodate on a smaller table. They weren't serving alcohol today, and for the next few days also they are keeping the bar closed. we had to compromise on that and had to order the virgins. We had the much hyped 'maanga' which was nice and refreshing. Homemade ginger beer was good. Brownie cookie shake wasn't available. For starters we had chilli cheese dragons, cheese filled cigar rolls with spicy garlic sauce, the sauce was amazing. Rock Corn tempura was good, crisp and the teriyaki sauce was appropriately done. Loaded nachos was amazing. Potato with raclette which was fried potatoes topped with stringy mozzarella cheese, was basic and slightly spiced toped with pickled jalape√±os. We also ordered two types of pizza , roasted zucchini with parmesan and tomatoes and the other, mushrooms with truffle oil. I loved the mushroom one over the zucchini one. But the pizza looked a bit messy and wasn't also evenly crisp. Overall the service was spontaneous and amiable. I liked the overall experience though. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Chopra | 34103337 | 4.5 | 2016-09-13 20:44:04 | Monkey Bar is a grown up version of a slightly more casual neighborhood bar. With about 300+ gastro pubs in India it is only a matter of time when people start aping. The Calcutta version is setting it apart from the rest of the so called gastro pubs.

We had the good fortune of going to the private opening of Monkey Bar Kolkata on the 1st September, 2016. It was a small party for about a 100 people. The mood was up beat and there was a sense of relief and satisfaction on the staff who were hosting us. It has taken Monkey Bar Kolkata a little over 8 months to complete the restaurant.

The staff is from all across the country. This makes for some good interaction with them ‚Äì that is if you care to chat them up. The cocktails are more involved. There is reasonable work that is done to create the drinks behind the counter. Work as in ingredients have been mixed and labor have been put in to create a concoction or mixes. Not just opening bottles and squirting premixes in a shaker and serving things up. Almost like an artisan touch. The bases are fermented in house; you can see the large glass jars filled and sitting happy on the bar counter.

To begins with the view is something you must visit let alone anything else. Add the food and you have method to mayhem. The care that goes in the food here is evident when you have your first bites. With Chef Manu Chandra at the helm of the kitchen things are definitely going to have certain standards in terms of flavor and quality. There is always going to be a reason behind why what ever has been done to the food in the kitchen here at Monkey Bar.

Expect massive flavors and good service. In fact it is so good to see the city opening up to the kinds of Monkey Bar. This is a place where you can come in and kick back with friends on a weekend. This is one tree that we two monkeys are happy to call home. |
 
Monkey Bar | Jayeeta Basu | 360426 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 21:01:52 | So finally Kolkata gets Monkey Bar!! 
I have always loved the Bangalore  and the Mumbai Monkey Bar because of the ambience.  
First day, the space and the view is amazing!! They had a very limited drinks menu considering first day. I had Toast to Calcutta, Manga and Copper Grin. Toast to Calcutta was refreshing, adding smoke gondhoraj lebu,  it tasted even better.  Manga is something I have drank before.  Copper Grin was okay. 
Let's get into the food menu.  Prawn ghee roast,  Vada Pav,  Keema Pav the menu took me back to Bombay and South. 
I had the Korean sticky wings,  since I already came to Monkey Bar  after having dinner,  I sticked to one starter and drinks!
I am planning to head back to Monkey Bar pretty soon for full fledged meal and lot of Toast to Calcutta! 
Please stock the bar as it is extremely disappointing to come to Monkey Bar and sit with limited choices in terms of alcohol. |
 
Monkey Bar | Arushi Dhupia | 1597321 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 19:14:22 | Monkey Bar is on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building on camac. Visit in the evening and if you're sitting by the window panes, you can see the Victoria Memorial, lights twinkling from The 42, and the outline of a part of the Parama flyover. It's so cool! 
The music is good and the place has a very funky feel to it. The food is good, not excellent. 
Loved the pizza and the Med platter.  Corn kernels were okayish. 
The Loaded Nachos were Brilliant!! Lots of sour cream and Mexican beans and fully loaded as the name suggests! No other places in kolkata (apart from the Big Nachos at |
 
Monkey Bar | Shhashee Churiwala | 2053496 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 23:48:39 | The newest hub in kolkata with different design and fresco depicting old kolkata. The giant size windows showing the serene skyline of the city. Exhaustive menu with both indian and international cuisine with a twist. Prompt service , great tasting dishes both starters and mains accompanied humble pricing. A great place to kill your hunger. All in all good experience after a long time. A must visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Aihik Barua | 1850614 | 3.5 | 2016-09-11 22:10:16 | This review might change. This post is influenced mostly due to the nonavailability of alcohol , and I did see two or three bottles of liquor , anyway , about the interiors and location , bloody superb amazing selection , love it , would suggest it anybody , the bartenders ( coke tenders üòÇ) seemed cocky , but it's a relief to see a high end restaurant serving beef, that's fresh and the it was good actually , would go again for the booze ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Mansi Tulshan | 33240285 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 21:17:40 | Went there in the evening today to check out all the hype surrounding it. Guess what! Wasn't disappointed at all. We took a seat right next to the window(yes, I have a fascination for tables next to Windows) and was mesmerised by the breathtaking view of the city. The music, ambience were perfect for a chilled out evening with a great date(note:my husband).
The lemon iced tea was very good.. Perfect in taste. The staff recommended ' the med platter 'as a great vegetarian option and we decided to try that. The platter had falafel, pita pockets, cheese and spinach filos, and the usual dips. The hummus was great and we were serves a hearty portion if it which made us happy coz it's the dips which usually are heroes of this dish. The babagonoush was great and it had a smokey taste which was really good. The curd and cucumber dip definitely needs improvement. It was runny and tasted like buttermilk! Had no taste and we left most of it. The best part of the ambience was hookah had a separate enclosure and wasn't served inside the main restaurant! Will definitely return to this place for a relaxing evening! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sajid Feroz | 60540 | 1.0 | 2016-09-11 17:20:01 | New place and pathetic service....guy at the reception refused to give a table coz I was alone and suggested a table outside in open when it was so  hot outside.After a while I was a given a table with no seat n ws suggested to stand n eat (brilliant!) Although after some protest a seat was provided.i even noticed couples were asked to share a table even when some of the tables were empty ! It was quite bizzare !! imagine going on a double date with some strangers ! It was like they just wanted to give table to group of 4 or more ,again like I said restaurant was not even full!

Food was served ..I ordered a prawn dish ,peach ice tea and the snicker bar for dessert.prawn dish was good ,the ice tea wasn't served n after 45 minutes of ordering I was told it's not available .the snicker bar was good (recommended) !! Some how all the servers were lost in their own world ,roaming around in groups n hardly paying attention to customers ..that too when there was no rush at all ! 
 
I am not tat critical while writing reviews but m quite surprised how casual the staff was while handling their customers (that too being a new place in town).I have been to monkey bar in Delhi and tat place is amazing ! 

Service - 0/5
Decor -4/5 (lovely view of Victoria memorial n hoogly bridge ) 
Food - 3.5 (would love to explore more) 

Must have - the snicker bar |
 
Monkey Bar | Aadarsh Agarwal | 1183989 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 17:18:45 | The ambience and location of the place was top notch. With the bar not licensed yet the food surely compensated. There is a separate outdoor section for shisha takers. Lastly, the view of Victoria was the cherry on the cake. |
 
Monkey Bar | Reevu Wangdi | 284286 | 5.0 | 2016-09-11 00:42:46 | Great place to chill & dine... best thing is they serve beef...Tiger beef was succulent and spiced to perfection... Korean bulgogi beef rice was flavoursome ... chorizo pork pav was delicious... ampanna done right... and service was tops... gonna be back when the bar opens ..I believe next week it is... good going .. |
 
Monkey Bar | Devanshi Powani | 33090142 | 3.5 | 2016-09-10 23:54:27 | The snicker bar desert and the Aam aadmi eggs were the highlight of our dinner. Can't wait for the bar to start . Loved the service and the ambience. |
 
Monkey Bar | Jashita Ray | 589467 | 4.0 | 2016-09-09 19:52:29 | Had been waiting eagerly for the opening of Monkey Bar and there I was dragging my fiance, paying a visit in the first week itself. However I would say i rather got slightly disappointed. The staff seemed amateur. They were very amiable but highly confused. Firstly it took them over 20-25mins with repetitive reminders to serve us water. And further disappointment was on asking for the drinks menu, they informed us they didn't have license for alcohol. Thus we had to settle for mocktails. The person who took our mocktail order was so confused. He was unsure of the mocktails on offer, we had to specifically cue him with names like green apple or blue lagoon etc. And oh, there was no paper napkins, spoons and forks or sauces kept on the table for us as some had mentioned in previous reviews - we had to ask for them. Probably they don't have them kept in advance in the open air section.
Now the good part - Everything else!
The ambience - Wow. The view of the Victoria Memorial is simply stunning. You can just sit and spend hours adoring your surroundings.
We ordered a teen paan hookah, along with a Virgin Mangaa- Loved it and a Green Apple Soda which was decent, not that great. Next on our list were the Butterflies, Rooster Booster Burger & Chicken 65. The first two were mouthwatering, especially the burger - juicy, filling, yummilicious. And then the cherry on the pie - the dessert - Snicker bar- I genuinely recommend this. Loved the way they serve it and the taste is heavenly.
Overall, had a lovely evening with the MoBar Mojo! Just wished I could give it a 5 star rating. |
 
Monkey Bar | Luna Chatterjee (Madly_Food_Lover) | 1304639 | 4.5 | 2016-09-09 01:36:56 | The Monkey has finally swung east, and that too it's making it's presence felt !! After Mumbai and Delhi now Kolkata hasit own "Monkey Bar". 
To start with It's an amazing property that has a breathtaking view. You can just gaze at Kolkata skyline while sipping some amazing cocktails.
Curated by acclaimed chef Manu Chandra, Monkey Bar's menu boasts of innovative food and drinks. I absolutely loved each and everything that i tasted but some of the items and drinks need spl mention.
Kerala Rice Salad- A salad made with wild red rice, blended with herbs and topped with curd chilli, the dish is indigenous and light.
Med Platter-A dish which is a visual delight in itself apart from being a total amalgamation of fritters and dips.
Tikki of Joy- A perfect dish to satisfy the bong fish craving.
Butterfly Chicken- Chicken blended with herbs placed inside a butterfly shaped shell.
Prawn Pil Pil- Perfectly prepared Prawn served with bread. Simple yet delicious
Laal Maas Phulka Tacos-Rajasthani laal mash intelligently placed inside tacos, a perfect fusion food.
Spare Pork Ribs- This is ansolutely recommended for those pork lovers. The meat is tender and cooked to perfection in barbecue sauce.
The drinks served quenched our thirst perfectly, among them some needs spl mentionlike Manga, Copper Monkey, Pink Punch. 
The desserts are absolutely delightful.Gondhoraj Lemon Tart is sweet, with a bit of tang!! There is Snicker Bar whichbis total bliss.
So with the coming of Monkey Bar i can safely say that gastronomic revolution has indeed hit our City of Joy. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anamitraa/The Gut Filling | 671420 | 4.0 | 2016-09-09 00:46:21 | The City of Joy is witnessing a major change in the gastronomic culture post the technological revolution of smartphones and wireless technology. There has been evolution of the global food and Calcuttans are gradually getting used to it. After many multinational and national pubs coming to Kolkata, it was the turn for Monkey Bar to refresh Kolkata with its gracious presence.

This 3rd September, I was invited to the Pre Launch of the Kolkata Chapter where the #MonkeySwungEast. It was a lovely happy afternoon where all the foodies, bloggers, critics and experts had a gala time with beautiful cocktails, mocktails and great good.

The place is located at the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building in Camac Street. Blessed with a wonderful view, you can see the Victoria Memorial, St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral and Hooghly Bridge altogether. We had to pick up paper pieces with names of cocktails and sit at the assigned table to participate in games and quizzes. It was a lot of fun. Ambience is all classy with the bar and high chair along with couches. I loved the wall art on the gateway to the open air sitting area which is done with Gupi Bagha, Tana Rickshaw and all the nostalgic memoirs of Kolkata.

The food was equally good. There were many cocktails and I, being a teetotaler had the virgin versions of all the drinks. Some of them were great, actually. We had ‚Äì

Kerala Red Rice Salad - Baby spinach, red rice, raw mango, coconut, peanuts and upmensinkai (salted chilli from Karnataka). I generally do not eat chillies, but this one was so good. Loved it a lot.

Mac & Cheese Croquettes ‚Äì Golden fried broccoli and peas along with chilli mayo and salsa. I am a fan of cheese. So the croquettes were really admired.

Med Platter - Falafel, spinach, cheese filo parcels, hummus, smoked baba ganoush, roasted peppers, olives, with pita bread and labneh. The presentation of this platter was really an eye catching one. It was really good.

Smoked Beetroot and Beans Galouti - Melt in mouth vegetarian galouti on saffron laced taftan, onion and mint chutney. This dish too was okay.

Baked Brie ‚Äì Oh! I loved this dish. Brie cheese with filo surrounded by pineapple salsa. The cheese oozing out of the pastry created all the sensation. Loved this dish a lot. Had a huge share of it from my table.

Prawn Pil Pil - Tossed in olive oil with chilli, garlic and parsley. It was served with garlic rubbed toast. This was extremely delicious. Loved the dish a lot specially for its aroma and the garlic breads, specially.

Tikki of Joy - Kolkata inspired Bhetki fish cutlets with kasundi, fennel seed & coriander, served with mint chutney. This is one classic dish which no Calcuttan will ever fail to love. I was no exception.

Tiger Beef - Slices of steak tossed with chilli paste, black beans, galangal, ginger, bean sprouts, lemon, bok choy and peppers. This dish was a bit spicy, not suited to my taste but loved by my fellow foodies at the table.

Butterfly Chicken - Sweet, spicy, crispy bits of chicken tossed with sesame, chilli, honey and peppers; stuffed in our signature butterfly shells. The butterfly shells resembled to a savoury treat from the lands of Andhra Pradesh, popularly known as Phoolbu. This dish was unique, in presentation and taste.

Laal Maas Phulka Tacos ‚Äì Who doesn‚Äôt know about this classical delicacy of Rajasthan? Monkey Bar has successfully fused this Indian beauty along with Mexican Tacos. This twist in the cuisines creates the beauty of the culinary culture and here lies the skill of a chef, who is an artist in this case. Loved this dish for the innovation.

Spare Pork Ribs ‚Äì Trust me, it is the best pork dish I have had till date. The pork was so soft, juicy and tender that it literally melted inside the mouth. It was tossed in a tangy and sweet sauce which was really good. Writing the review after 5-6 days but I still can‚Äôt get over the beauty of the pork ribs.

Gondhoraj Lime Tart ‚Äì This was one unique dessert we have tried there. Lemon curd, torched meringue, lemon & mint gel, pistachio cake & cookie crust ‚Äì combination of all good things at one go. Loved the refreshing vibe of this dessert.

The Snicker Bar ‚Äì I am not a big Snicker fan. But this dessert along with the perfect swirls of the s‚Äômore has become one of the desserts to crave for at the strangest of times. Milk chocolate ganache, dark chocolate micro cake, hazelnut praline cream, salted caramel gel being the composition of this dessert, I loved it till the end.

Drinks ‚Äì Copper Monkey, Manga, Pack of Punch, Toast To Calcutta, Mad Men. I was in Team Copper Monkey. Had the virgin version of all the drinks. Liked the Manga to be the best, which they claim to be one of their signature cocktails along with Copper Monkey, which was also very good.

I would like to thank the nationally acclaimed figure Chef Manu Chandra to spend and share his valuable words about food and Team Monkey Bar for having us over and presenting a lifetime of memories. Best wishes to the team and may they prosper ahead. Happy Dining! :) |
 
Monkey Bar | The Hungry Desis (Ramya & Chiranjeev) | 30569103 | 4.5 | 2016-09-08 16:29:59 | Monkey Bar has finally come to the City of Joy and promises to be a perfect place to have fun and relax. When we walked into the gastropub, the first thing that came to our minds was "classy and quirky".¬†
The best of it all is the stunning view.  You have a clear sight of the St. Paul's Cathedral and the Victoria Memorial in the distance. The service staff are swift and attentive.
 Another thoughtful design is the assortment of condiments and cutlery set on the tables. You can use them as you like instead of calling for the servers everytime. The cocktails are innovative, using a variety of ingredients and the food is lip-smackingly delicious! Our recommendations are the Mangaa and the Tipsy Sherbet among the drinks. With regards to the food, the vegetarian dishes are as good as the non vegetarian ones. We suggest the Med Platter and the Baked Brie among the vegetarian choices. For the non-vegetarians, the Prawn Pil Pil is a must try. To achieve full satiisfaction, do sample the Snicker Bar..it is to die for! |
 
Monkey Bar | Varnika | 380228 | 4.5 | 2016-09-07 10:06:59 | The wait is finally over. The moment you enter Monkey Bar, you get the feel of the one in Bangalore. The open air area is simply amazing, the view of Victoria Memorial is breathtaking. 
I loved the ambience of the inner section as well. Even though it has some basic monkey bar elements missing the place is great overall. 
We ordered the MoBar Classic Chilli Cheese Dragons which were to die for. 
For drinks we had the Copper One which was quite bad. It didn't taste of Alcohol at all. 
Taste of Calcutta was refreshing and nice. Pack a punch was also decent. 
All in all once they start functioning full time and properly it will be a great place. Super excited! |
 
Monkey Bar | Roli Vajpeyi | 909801 | 5.0 | 2016-09-06 23:07:49 | Monkey bar finally opens in Kolkata! You guys are in for a treat the cocktails are so unique and nice you can't just order one! And the snacks are just awesome. This is my new hang out place. The desserts specially the snickers one is just amazing. |

Saldanha Bakery | Shaurya Pathak | 367302 | 4.0 | 2016-12-17 21:09:23 | It will be a time taking process to find this place. But it will test your resolve for the love of food.
Don't look around. Just look down and enjoy the lip smacking goodies. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Kashif Ahmed | 1115831 | 4.5 | 2016-12-14 19:10:28 | Surprisingly, this joint serves the best Walnut Cakes i have ever tasted in my life..... It is a very old bakery.... The patties is also lip smacking....
Strongly recommend the Walnut Cake, try it once....But kindly refrain from taking your vehicle as parking is a serious pain..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Amrita Mondal | 36255179 | 4.0 | 2016-10-28 21:36:46 | The best bakery in town for traditional Christmas goodies like fruit cake, walnut cake, plain butter cake, plum cake, Brownies, tarts, etc. It is a place where bulk orders are taken generally. It is not a shop or a cafe. It is a bakery where you order stuff and take away. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tuks4 | 36484659 | 4.5 | 2016-10-25 00:29:07 | ive been an indirect customer of this bakery for a while.. my sis's school orders their items regularly and i get to taste them too :)
this time though, i went to the place & had my own order.. a good number of chicken & corn envelope & choc truffle cake, both eggless & w/ egg..

my 1 line verdict.. the BEST bakery in the city.. period. in terms of taste + price + raw materials + the care + the old-school process, this is without doubt the best place in Calcutta.. & i repeat CALCUTTA and not kolkatta or kolkutta or some other rubbish misnaming this city gets !
this is the place that makes proper patties, proper macrones, cakes & pastries.. almost all of their items taste uniquely clean & refined.. and someone with a decent palette, will feel the 'non-commercial' taste as well..

i had a client team visiting from Poland who were extremely happy eating these items..¬† chicken envelope is their costliest item @35 a pc.. v filling yet flaky & light.. the choc truffle cake melted away inside the mouth.. super soft !
ul see amul butter being used to fry the onions.. pure almond crumbs being used inside the cake's base.. egg whites been beaten for 30mins until those nice soft peaks show up.. no wonder the taste is superlative !

few downsides to mention.. the cheese puff is not good at all.. slice cakes are sometimes stiff.. the place can do better without being that cluttery.. someone with a nose for hygiene might not be thrilled with all the 'hands' being used.. but i guess that too is their USP at some point :) |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anushka Agarwal | 34748091 | 3.5 | 2016-10-24 11:21:12 | Been to this joint lately and loved their brownies and cakes. They are freshly baked and delicious both at the same time. Usually if you go to this place during late evening you'll miss out on most of the stuffs. Pre-ordering recommended. ‚úåüèªÔ∏è |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Debadyuti Karan | 5018051 | 4.0 | 2016-08-30 22:52:05 | Kolkata is full of sweet surprises. Who would ever guess that an old yellow house in central Kolkata houses one of the best bakeries in town?! A cake lovers paradise, this bakery is famous for its weddings cakes for the Anglo Indians. Good things don't come easy; one needs to make an effort to relish their creations. A pre order is a must at this 80 year old bakery. While most of their stuff is good, the must must must on the order list would be their almond cake, coconut macaroons and their soft moist dark brownies. If you are lucky and drop by you might find some' bakes' of the day that you could pick up. Debra Saldanha one of the daughters now runs the place and maintains the high quality standard set by her parents. The place is not a fancy store. They know their quality is far better than most bakeries in town and they let their baking do the talking. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Rajtilak Bhattacharjee | 68484 | 5.0 | 2016-08-20 22:28:12 | The best bakery in Kolkata. Must try their almond cakes, macaroons, and chocolate fudges. You can pre-order, although there is no home delivery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Indrajit Lahiri | 542545 | 4.5 | 2016-08-02 16:47:16 | There goes around a story in Kolkata gastronomic circuit that the best traditional l anglo-Indian cakes are found not in fancy hotels, but in few homes, and over the period of time, they‚Äôve become legends. Many have heard of the name, but few have actually been there, the name‚Äôs Saldanha Bakery and Confectionary

One should reach Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road (the tram road) and find out the B C Sen Jewellery shop on it. While in the afternoon, the traffic moves towards north, it comes on the right hand side. Take the adjacent lane and after 50-100 mtrs, you can find a yellow house on your left with Saldanha written on the outside wall. Parking is a big big problem. Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tisyaketu Sirkar | 3479861 | 5.0 | 2016-07-14 13:57:20 | This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Sumit Surai | 11641 | 4.0 | 2016-07-13 22:52:39 | This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Arjun Kumar Roy | 33434945 | 5.0 | 2016-05-18 00:48:34 | Its an amazing bakery where we get great some authentic baked products. Please try their cakes, mousses and other stuff... Its one the oldest in our city and serves you upto your expectations... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anwesha Ghosh | 14295941 | 3.5 | 2016-02-12 19:26:47 | One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Jude Martin | 1895578 | 4.0 | 2016-01-26 23:48:16 | Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Suhail Hassan | 684685 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 15:28:43 | Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items**** |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Koushik Paul | 16411585 | 4.5 | 2016-01-09 10:10:47 | What to say about this!! It is actually a hidden gem! One of my friend suggested this for Christmas cake shopping. It made us tired to find it out but cakes are actually superb!!! |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Oindrila Paul | 16152668 | 5.0 | 2016-01-08 00:38:34 | I will give 5 stars to this bakery because I've eaten here many a times and if has never let me down. Right from it's vegetarian items to the non vegetarian ones, and from the pastries to the cakes, Saldanha is pure bliss |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Madhurya Chaudhuri | 30816267 | 4.5 | 2016-01-06 21:09:10 | Awesome cakes,brownies,lemon drops and chicken patties . British cakes are the best. Assorted chocolates are good too. And everything comes in a very reasonable price. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Swarnendu Chandra | 32142557 | 5.0 | 2016-01-02 14:06:38 | I visited this place after reading a report in a local newspaper, and experience was mesmerizing. The walnut cake and fruit cake was simply delicious. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Souvik Sen | 9493051 | 4.5 | 2015-12-29 16:56:20 | Great Cakes I must say...This year I had their walnut & chocolate cakes in Christmas...Both was fabulous...Walnut was better...Price was INR 220/- per cake but considering the quality it really worth it..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Apple Orange | 31197595 | 5.0 | 2015-12-25 17:26:35 | I have never been to the shop but in our office every year during Christmas we get cakes from Saldanah Bakery and it is never enough...The Christmas cakes are simply what a first class cake should be...soft ...fresh and...the level sweetness is just right..love it every year and now it's  a ritual...will be visiting soon..üòäüòäüòä |

Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tisyaketu Sirkar | 3479861 | 5.0 | 2016-07-14 13:57:20 | This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Sumit Surai | 11641 | 4.0 | 2016-07-13 22:52:39 | This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Arjun Kumar Roy | 33434945 | 5.0 | 2016-05-18 00:48:34 | Its an amazing bakery where we get great some authentic baked products. Please try their cakes, mousses and other stuff... Its one the oldest in our city and serves you upto your expectations... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anwesha Ghosh | 14295941 | 3.5 | 2016-02-12 19:26:47 | One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Jude Martin | 1895578 | 4.0 | 2016-01-26 23:48:16 | Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Suhail Hassan | 684685 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 15:28:43 | Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items**** |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Koushik Paul | 16411585 | 4.5 | 2016-01-09 10:10:47 | What to say about this!! It is actually a hidden gem! One of my friend suggested this for Christmas cake shopping. It made us tired to find it out but cakes are actually superb!!! |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Oindrila Paul | 16152668 | 5.0 | 2016-01-08 00:38:34 | I will give 5 stars to this bakery because I've eaten here many a times and if has never let me down. Right from it's vegetarian items to the non vegetarian ones, and from the pastries to the cakes, Saldanha is pure bliss |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Madhurya Chaudhuri | 30816267 | 4.5 | 2016-01-06 21:09:10 | Awesome cakes,brownies,lemon drops and chicken patties . British cakes are the best. Assorted chocolates are good too. And everything comes in a very reasonable price. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Swarnendu Chandra | 32142557 | 5.0 | 2016-01-02 14:06:38 | I visited this place after reading a report in a local newspaper, and experience was mesmerizing. The walnut cake and fruit cake was simply delicious. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Souvik Sen | 9493051 | 4.5 | 2015-12-29 16:56:20 | Great Cakes I must say...This year I had their walnut & chocolate cakes in Christmas...Both was fabulous...Walnut was better...Price was INR 220/- per cake but considering the quality it really worth it..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Apple Orange | 31197595 | 5.0 | 2015-12-25 17:26:35 | I have never been to the shop but in our office every year during Christmas we get cakes from Saldanah Bakery and it is never enough...The Christmas cakes are simply what a first class cake should be...soft ...fresh and...the level sweetness is just right..love it every year and now it's  a ritual...will be visiting soon..üòäüòäüòä |

Strongly recommend the Walnut Cake, try it once....But kindly refrain from taking your vehicle as parking is a serious pain..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Amrita Mondal | 36255179 | 4.0 | 2016-10-28 21:36:46 | The best bakery in town for traditional Christmas goodies like fruit cake, walnut cake, plain butter cake, plum cake, Brownies, tarts, etc. It is a place where bulk orders are taken generally. It is not a shop or a cafe. It is a bakery where you order stuff and take away. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tuks4 | 36484659 | 4.5 | 2016-10-25 00:29:07 | ive been an indirect customer of this bakery for a while.. my sis's school orders their items regularly and i get to taste them too :)
this time though, i went to the place & had my own order.. a good number of chicken & corn envelope & choc truffle cake, both eggless & w/ egg..

my 1 line verdict.. the BEST bakery in the city.. period. in terms of taste + price + raw materials + the care + the old-school process, this is without doubt the best place in Calcutta.. & i repeat CALCUTTA and not kolkatta or kolkutta or some other rubbish misnaming this city gets !
this is the place that makes proper patties, proper macrones, cakes & pastries.. almost all of their items taste uniquely clean & refined.. and someone with a decent palette, will feel the 'non-commercial' taste as well..

i had a client team visiting from Poland who were extremely happy eating these items..¬† chicken envelope is their costliest item @35 a pc.. v filling yet flaky & light.. the choc truffle cake melted away inside the mouth.. super soft !
ul see amul butter being used to fry the onions.. pure almond crumbs being used inside the cake's base.. egg whites been beaten for 30mins until those nice soft peaks show up.. no wonder the taste is superlative !

few downsides to mention.. the cheese puff is not good at all.. slice cakes are sometimes stiff.. the place can do better without being that cluttery.. someone with a nose for hygiene might not be thrilled with all the 'hands' being used.. but i guess that too is their USP at some point :) |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anushka Agarwal | 34748091 | 3.5 | 2016-10-24 11:21:12 | Been to this joint lately and loved their brownies and cakes. They are freshly baked and delicious both at the same time.

Saldanha Bakery | Debadyuti Karan | 5018051 | 4.0 | 2016-08-30 22:52:05 | Kolkata is full of sweet surprises. Who would ever guess that an old yellow house in central Kolkata houses one of the best bakeries in town?! A cake lovers paradise, this bakery is famous for its weddings cakes for the Anglo Indians. Good things don't come easy; one needs to make an effort to relish their creations. A pre order is a must at this 80 year old bakery. While most of their stuff is good, the must must must on the order list would be their almond cake, coconut macaroons and their soft moist dark brownies. If you are lucky and drop by you might find some' bakes' of the day that you could pick up. Debra Saldanha one of the daughters now runs the place and maintains the high quality standard set by her parents. The place is not a fancy store. They know their quality is far better than most bakeries in town and they let their baking do the talking. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Rajtilak Bhattacharjee | 68484 | 5.0 | 2016-08-20 22:28:12 | The best bakery in Kolkata. Must try their almond cakes, macaroons, and chocolate fudges. You can pre-order, although there is no home delivery. |

The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tisyaketu Sirkar | 3479861 | 5.0 | 2016-07-14 13:57:20 | This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Sumit Surai | 11641 | 4.0 | 2016-07-13 22:52:39 | This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Arjun Kumar Roy | 33434945 | 5.0 | 2016-05-18 00:48:34 | Its an amazing bakery where we get great some authentic baked products. Please try their cakes, mousses and other stuff... Its one the oldest in our city and serves you upto your expectations... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anwesha Ghosh | 14295941 | 3.5 | 2016-02-12 19:26:47 | One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Jude Martin | 1895578 | 4.0 | 2016-01-26 23:48:16 | Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Suhail Hassan | 684685 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 15:28:43 | Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items**** |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Koushik Paul | 16411585 | 4.5 | 2016-01-09 10:10:47 | What to say about this!! It is actually a hidden gem! One of my friend suggested this for Christmas cake shopping. It made us tired to find it out but cakes are actually superb!!! |

Saldanha Bakery | Shaurya Pathak | 367302 | 4.0 | 2016-12-17 21:09:23 | It will be a time taking process to find this place. But it will test your resolve for the love of food.
Don't look around. Just look down and enjoy the lip smacking goodies. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Kashif Ahmed | 1115831 | 4.5 | 2016-12-14 19:10:28 | Surprisingly, this joint serves the best Walnut Cakes i have ever tasted in my life..... It is a very old bakery.... The patties is also lip smacking....
Strongly recommend the Walnut Cake, try it once....But kindly refrain from taking your vehicle as parking is a serious pain..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Amrita Mondal | 36255179 | 4.0 | 2016-10-28 21:36:46 | The best bakery in town for traditional Christmas goodies like fruit cake, walnut cake, plain butter cake, plum cake, Brownies, tarts, etc. It is a place where bulk orders are taken generally. It is not a shop or a cafe. It is a bakery where you order stuff and take away. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tuks4 | 36484659 | 4.5 | 2016-10-25 00:29:07 | ive been an indirect customer of this bakery for a while.. my sis's school orders their items regularly and i get to taste them too :)
this time though, i went to the place & had my own order.. a good number of chicken & corn envelope & choc truffle cake, both eggless & w/ egg..

my 1 line verdict.. the BEST bakery in the city.. period. in terms of taste + price + raw materials + the care + the old-school process, this is without doubt the best place in Calcutta.. & i repeat CALCUTTA and not kolkatta or kolkutta or some other rubbish misnaming this city gets !
this is the place that makes proper patties, proper macrones, cakes & pastries.. almost all of their items taste uniquely clean & refined.. and someone with a decent palette, will feel the 'non-commercial' taste as well..

i had a client team visiting from Poland who were extremely happy eating these items..¬† chicken envelope is their costliest item @35 a pc.. v filling yet flaky & light.. the choc truffle cake melted away inside the mouth.. super soft !
ul see amul butter being used to fry the onions.. pure almond crumbs being used inside the cake's base.. egg whites been beaten for 30mins until those nice soft peaks show up.. no wonder the taste is superlative !

few downsides to mention.. the cheese puff is not good at all.. slice cakes are sometimes stiff.. the place can do better without being that cluttery.. someone with a nose for hygiene might not be thrilled with all the 'hands' being used.. but i guess that too is their USP at some point :) |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anushka Agarwal | 34748091 | 3.5 | 2016-10-24 11:21:12 | Been to this joint lately and loved their brownies and cakes. They are freshly baked and delicious both at the same time. Usually if you go to this place during late evening you'll miss out on most of the stuffs. Pre-ordering recommended. ‚úåüèªÔ∏è |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Debadyuti Karan | 5018051 | 4.0 | 2016-08-30 22:52:05 | Kolkata is full of sweet surprises. Who would ever guess that an old yellow house in central Kolkata houses one of the best bakeries in town?! A cake lovers paradise, this bakery is famous for its weddings cakes for the Anglo Indians. Good things don't come easy; one needs to make an effort to relish their creations. A pre order is a must at this 80 year old bakery. While most of their stuff is good, the must must must on the order list would be their almond cake, coconut macaroons and their soft moist dark brownies. If you are lucky and drop by you might find some' bakes' of the day that you could pick up. Debra Saldanha one of the daughters now runs the place and maintains the high quality standard set by her parents. The place is not a fancy store. They know their quality is far better than most bakeries in town and they let their baking do the talking. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Rajtilak Bhattacharjee | 68484 | 5.0 | 2016-08-20 22:28:12 | The best bakery in Kolkata. Must try their almond cakes, macaroons, and chocolate fudges. You can pre-order, although there is no home delivery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Indrajit Lahiri | 542545 | 4.5 | 2016-08-02 16:47:16 | There goes around a story in Kolkata gastronomic circuit that the best traditional l anglo-Indian cakes are found not in fancy hotels, but in few homes, and over the period of time, they‚Äôve become legends. Many have heard of the name, but few have actually been there, the name‚Äôs Saldanha Bakery and Confectionary

One should reach Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road (the tram road) and find out the B C Sen Jewellery shop on it. While in the afternoon, the traffic moves towards north, it comes on the right hand side. Take the adjacent lane and after 50-100 mtrs, you can find a yellow house on your left with Saldanha written on the outside wall. Parking is a big big problem. Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

One should reach Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road (the tram road) and find out the B C Sen Jewellery shop on it. While in the afternoon, the traffic moves towards north, it comes on the right hand side. Take the adjacent lane and after 50-100 mtrs, you can find a yellow house on your left with Saldanha written on the outside wall. Parking is a big big problem. Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tisyaketu Sirkar | 3479861 | 5.0 | 2016-07-14 13:57:20 | This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Sumit Surai | 11641 | 4.0 | 2016-07-13 22:52:39 | This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Arjun Kumar Roy | 33434945 | 5.0 | 2016-05-18 00:48:34 | Its an amazing bakery where we get great some authentic baked products. Please try their cakes, mousses and other stuff... Its one the oldest in our city and serves you upto your expectations... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anwesha Ghosh | 14295941 | 3.5 | 2016-02-12 19:26:47 | One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Jude Martin | 1895578 | 4.0 | 2016-01-26 23:48:16 | Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Suhail Hassan | 684685 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 15:28:43 | Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items**** |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Koushik Paul | 16411585 | 4.5 | 2016-01-09 10:10:47 | What to say about this!! It is actually a hidden gem! One of my friend suggested this for Christmas cake shopping. It made us tired to find it out but cakes are actually superb!!! |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Oindrila Paul | 16152668 | 5.0 | 2016-01-08 00:38:34 | I will give 5 stars to this bakery because I've eaten here many a times and if has never let me down. Right from it's vegetarian items to the non vegetarian ones, and from the pastries to the cakes, Saldanha is pure bliss |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Madhurya Chaudhuri | 30816267 | 4.5 | 2016-01-06 21:09:10 | Awesome cakes,brownies,lemon drops and chicken patties . British cakes are the best. Assorted chocolates are good too. And everything comes in a very reasonable price. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Swarnendu Chandra | 32142557 | 5.0 | 2016-01-02 14:06:38 | I visited this place after reading a report in a local newspaper, and experience was mesmerizing. The walnut cake and fruit cake was simply delicious. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Souvik Sen | 9493051 | 4.5 | 2015-12-29 16:56:20 | Great Cakes I must say...This year I had their walnut & chocolate cakes in Christmas...Both was fabulous...Walnut was better...Price was INR 220/- per cake but considering the quality it really worth it..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Apple Orange | 31197595 | 5.0 | 2015-12-25 17:26:35 | I have never been to the shop but in our office every year during Christmas we get cakes from Saldanah Bakery and it is never enough...The Christmas cakes are simply what a first class cake should be...soft ...fresh and...the level sweetness is just right..love it every year and now it's  a ritual...will be visiting soon..üòäüòäüòä |

Kafe 6/2B | Piko Biswas | None | 410422 | 4.0 | 2015-11-22 11:11:50 | This place is really close to my house, and I popped over with my mom one day to try out some cold stuff. It's a small cozy place, with really sweet quaint decor, flowers, and soft pretty colours, and plentiful lighting, and pretty picture windows. Being really small, it ensured personal attention from the lady who helped us select our food. We had a Tutti Frutti ice cream sundae, and a cold coffee. Service was pretty fast and both tasted really good. The prices are pretty affordable, considering the great quality of the stuff we tasted. I'll definitely go back for more. It's perfect for an evening outing with a few friends, or as a me-time excursion. A plus point is the huge range of Paperboat products they have! |

Desi Lane | Pooja Agarwal | None | 329057 | 4.0 | 2016-12-09 14:48:40 | Okay.. So desi lane is easily located and has replaced food bazar in alipore.  Peppy ambience with very thoughtful interiors. It has seperate sections ..u enter like a bollywood star.  Look around and feel like I have entered a bollywood setup . Rocking interiors however it needs complimenting music too. 
The waiters are very enthusiastic to serve you.. So the service is pretty good. (They need to take a break as the customers need their privacy to talk too!!) 

Coming to the food.. Its value for money . I had oan fried noodles and a pina colada.. Decent.  :-) it's on my next visit list to try more of the space . |

Desi Lane | Poulami Prasad | None | 16328041 | 4.5 | 2016-12-05 09:58:22 | Just wow!! Yesterday night went 4 a bday party!! Grt ambience food was also good, satisfied service and a very nice place to hangout with friends.. The hookah was served with a bad coal though but they quickly replaced it and the chicken drumsticks was too spicy..  but the dance floor and the ambience was  attractive.. Thanks for a good time! ! |
 
Desi Lane | Vasuki Jasani | None | 34767270 | 5.0 | 2016-12-01 09:39:59 | We planned on having my parent's 25th wedding anniversary here and it was the best decision we made.
Ambience of this place just justifies its name and every bit of it has a desi touch. It gave a very cozy or rather comfortable feeling.
Drinks served to us were perfectly made and d starters were served absolutely hot.
This place has amazng props to click pictures with and the look of the entrance is gorgeous.....totally a picture taking zone!!!
Most importantly the food was delicious, the dal makhani, punjabi aloo and biryani is a must try here. |

Complete paisa wasool.....i got so many thank u messages from my friends saying that they never had such rocking party. Great party, great DJ, excellent service, the staffs were there till 2.30 am without a sign of frustration on their faces rather they were so very helpful. One of my friend was little high & puked. I wl never forget the service the manager gave to my friend. 
Thank u Desi Lane....I m really touched |

The ambience is simply something one has never experienced in Kolkata before. It is just like a local street with barber shops type themes, movie posters, khatiyas¬†(beds) as sitting places, etc etc... What's more is there's an Autorickshaw and a typical Bajaj scooter inside the place to excite all... The nostalgic movie posters from the golden era of Hindi ¬†cinema, the witty phrases all around will amuse you... It's like a walk down the memory lane of the old times before modernization of India.¬†

Additionally, there are games that one can play like the foosball, darts, spin a wheel, dice etc.

Wide choice of food and drinks with a variety of cocktails and mocktails will surely delight your taste buds. It's a fun place to be for sure and definitely a place one should visit with family and friends alike. Wouldn't like to spoil the fun by saying all that I found interesting there... So do visit this place if you get a chance...¬†One thing is for certain, if anyone visits Desi Lane, he or she is bound to return... for its one place you can never forget.

Keep up the good work Team Desi Lane!!! |

Desi Lane | Sohini Sarkar | None | 33862921 | 3.5 | 2016-10-19 22:51:46 | Bring that color back in your dull looking life with colorful and tasty food in Desi Lane.

Welcoming you from the lanes of Alipore are multitudes of rainbow colored bulbs, old Bollywood posters and even a cute, yellow scooter.

Located on the posh street of Burdwan Road, Alipore, this place falls right after the SBI building.

Prettily decorated place, with spot clean tables, the restaurant cum lounge bar is divided into two settings. While the immediate entrance of the place leads you to their moderately large sized restaurant hall, the hookah lounge is located behind a cushioned closed door.

The lounge room has a large screen TV. They make their shisha good. Hitting the strong flavours are paan salsa, paan rasna while grape is noticeably a mild flavor. 

Their Chili Cheese Toast is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. This maybe a bit of extra enthusiasm for a piece of toast, but it deserves all of it. Crispy base with gooey cheese on top. And that is not all, the flavor is off the roof. A five out of five for this item.

Although this place deserves a five, there are somethings that disappointed me as a customer massively. The service here is bad.

I had ordered cheese sandwich for myself, but our waiter had misunderstood it to be toasts. The toasts as stated earlier were excellent. No complaints regarding that. However, the miscommunication led to a bill that was way too much.

Although it was later taken care of by the staff team, this sort of mistakes really does ruin a customer's experience on a huge scale.

The food here is excellent. So is the decor and the ambiance, hence the 3.5

I'll be coming back here because the food I believe deserves more than what I rated. One of your hidden gems in Alipore. Drop by and be amazed. |
 
Desi Lane | AkritiPoddar | None | 16125324 | 4.0 | 2016-10-17 14:04:28 | Amazingly themed and offers a great ambience. The quirky posters and the Desi khatiya were well thought of. Could be visited with both family and friends as the place hosts family crowds as well. The Service is very quick and they ensure all guests have a good time.
Do check out the Chinese dishes if you're looking for something spicy and crisp. 
Desi Lane surely lives up to it's name by creating the most suitable environment for Desi lovers. |

Desi Lane | Surolia | None | 898402 | 5.0 | 2016-10-06 15:03:21 | Been to Desi Lane. Had vegetarian food over there without onion and garlic. I can say that no other restaurant can offer such delicious good without onion & garlic.
Hariyali Daal, Desi Videshi mixed veg and Fried Ice Cream are signature dishes which one can relish over there. |
 
Desi Lane | Ankita Patni | None | 3072545 | 4.5 | 2016-10-04 00:19:09 | One word for desi Lane ' WoW' . everything is so good about the place. Food, staffs , music , ambience , vibes . loved it to the core. Amazing ambience.  You feel so positive and happy here. Nice food. Must visit . |
 
Desi Lane | Swati Singhania | None | 1793405 | 5.0 | 2016-10-01 19:52:00 | I have been to this few times by now, and every time I step in the place..its always brimming with life. The food here is awesome.  I have tried their North indian food, Chinese and also few of the Italian dishes. All of them very relished by my taste buds.  But the best thing about the restaurant is that it has carved out a space for all. A separate section for family groups and parallely a separate section when you are dining with your friends. 
You can walk into the place and let the balance be taken care by their courteous team. Seems I have found another favorite joint! |

Desi Lane | Pamela Nandi | None | 2821382 | 4.0 | 2016-09-29 21:04:20 | Located on the first floor of the bldg The Enclave at the Alipore StateBank crossing - perfect adda placeto chill out with friends in desi style. Visited one sunday evening - the place is over crowded and noisy. But the highway like¬† theme with roadside low seaters and the bar - Desi Theeka will attract every guest to visit this place again and again. There are private dinning areas for family who would prefer to enjoy food away from the crowd and noise. Nothing new in the menu, but the food was good - butter lemon fish. In terms of service and hospitality, this eatery is a bit messy. Looks like they are still not yet well settled to serve the guests. |
 
Desi Lane | Sweta Agarwal | None | 36152816 | 5.0 | 2016-09-28 15:00:42 | A newly opened Resto bar in Alipore, the place is a must visit whether you planning a casual dine out with friends, family time over food, Night out with music and drinks or a private party for your group. The theme - totally desi with the right combination of quirkiness, adores the walls and indoors and the food - perfect for every taste and cuisine. Don't forget to get yourself clicked at the photo booth, on the scooter or inside the auto. Options galore, Desi Lane rocks.. |

Looks expensive but reasonable enough to plane for a date or a family dinner.
Thumps up for this place! !!!!!!!!!! |
 
Desi Lane | Gaurav Vyas | None | 31237453 | 5.0 | 2016-09-27 13:51:22 | We had the best Chinese food the other night at desi lane.

Desi Lane | Aakriti | None | 35147778 | 5.0 | 2016-09-19 14:12:06 | Awesome ambience and good food. This new restaurant houses a lounge, a separate hookah room , a karaoke room and the main floor. Quirky paintings and pictures adorn the walls with a great and colourful entry giving you the ultimate North Indian feel. They did a good job with the food as well. A must try |
 
Desi Lane | Deepshikha Saraf | None | 258224 | 2.5 | 2016-09-18 18:18:42 | The restaurant opened right next to my place. Had been planning to visit for a long while, ever since the soft launch. 
The ambience is okay. Desi lane doesn't match with the feel. The old posters is the only design feel. The chairs are so high! Almost like a bar. And the sofa are so low. The distance between the table and the sofa is so much that u have to shift aage and bend over to eat!!! 

The food is a major let down. We were two of us. So we order cheese kurkure kebab as starters- it was  bland. The roti covering was to thick. And the filling was bland. All u could taste was cheese. No seasoning, nothing. 

Then we ordered for a hariyali sabji moti and a lachcha paratha. The sabji was horrible 
üôàüôàüôà semi raw veggies, bland taste. 

The roti though was crisp and thin. |
 
Desi Lane | Avantika Agarwal | None | 35835337 | 4.5 | 2016-09-16 11:32:11 | Desi Lane offers an ultimate desi experience, With delicious food and desi decor, it is definitely worth a try. To add to it, It has a very convenient location.¬†

This desi restaurant is every foodie's delight and it offers a large variety of cuisines. ¬†The ambience is very desi and different¬†with khatiyas and autos. We ordered crackling spinach, spaghetti¬†nepolitan,¬† risotto and pizza which tasted very good. We also ordered hookah which was very smooth. ¬†

The staff was very friendly. I strongly recommend this place. |
 
Desi Lane | Ankita Sharma | None | 35907184 | 5.0 | 2016-09-16 11:26:02 | It is one of my favourites in Kolkata.

Desi Lane | Sneha Bhowmick | None | 35906810 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 17:26:54 | Newly opened with outstanding ambience and DJ on the dance floor. The food was also really great. The main sitting area houses some cool ‚ÄòCharpai‚Äô, as one may see on the roadside Dhabas. The Charpai section has been divided into separate halves, with each of these halves, displaying a unique theme of its own.¬† However it's worth a visit. |

Desi Lane | Hari Sharma | None | 35949145 | 5.0 | 2016-09-12 13:06:42 | Went on a Sunday. It was chocobloc. Still preferred to wait for almost 35 - 40 mins. Have no idea how almost 40 minutes passed. I Was just looking at the amazing interiors & my wife & son were busy taking selfies. So courteous staffs that even after being over occupied due to heavy rush they served us water & offered a fresh lime to my son free of cost...100 rupee worth of free fresh lime is not a big deal but its difficult to see this kind of a personal touch & respect for guests ...most restaurants don't even allow to stand in the restaurant area when they are full.  Food quality was equaly good & worth the wait. As far as the food quality is concerned would rate it amont the top 3 in kolkata. Will recommend a must must visit for this place. Completely in love with this place. |

Desi Lane | Megha | None | 1936800 | 1.0 | 2016-09-11 20:12:58 | Placed an order for a chicken steak and a chicken tikka masala kabab for home delivery. After 20 mins of placing the order I got a call from them saying that the steak was not available. I went ahead with the kabab order. 
The kabab was absolutely chewy and unedible!! The mint chutney served with it was watery. I don't think that I would want to order again. Paid 450 bucks for this. What a waste of money!!! |

The only problem I found was the noise coming from the lounge everytime the door opens , that's too loud for the people sitting inside. |

The food was awesome, the energy of the team of Desi lane was such that they were eager to give us a great experience. Loved every moment. Thank you desi lane for making our evening memorable. |

Desi Lane | Juhi Ramakant | None | 34669926 | 1.0 | 2016-08-20 17:26:51 | First of all its got no signage at ground level making it tough to locate
when you reach the first floor, it looks like under construction because of the outside
seating is not really comfortable and the place is too too bright that it hurts the eye
the food is below average and there is a massive room for improvment
the service is quick which is the only thing i liked about the place |
 
Desi Lane | Sudipta Majumdar | None | 843646 | 4.5 | 2016-08-19 22:08:23 | Curious me dropped in Desi Lane on the very first week of its opening and I was clearly bowled out by the vibrant ambience.Located in plush Alipore, this themed den can be best described as a place that encourages one to unwind with good friends. This week I returned to celebrate my birthday with a whole bunch of pals, and my guests had a rolling time. The in-house Dj sure knows how to keep you on the dance floor. The selfie wall is to die for, and the food was just the perfect accompaniment. Having our slurp of tom kha gai or the lip-smacking Desi Lane special meatballs would be remembered for long. A space buzzing with desi vibes, the place surely created a whole new experience for us friends.  Thank you Desi Lane for making my birthday celebration an affair to cherish. |

The ambiance is superb and the place is amazing in so many ways. This place really took me on a nostalgic trip with its interiors. Food and Drinks: Well, this part was really amazing. Starters were a lovely affair. I started off with
with ‚ÄúShajani Murgh Bahar‚Äù and my veggie friend‚Äôs favorite ‚ÄúGolden Baby corn with Spinach Sauce‚Äù both was delicious! 
The main course was the next best thing to arrive on our table. 
Mutton Rara Ghost .. you should not miss this one , its best in the town . Mutton is soft to the core with one Kabli Naan . On the other hand my friend was moved with ‚Äú Benarashi Dum alu and ‚Äú Lacheder paratha..

Coming to the desserts, we ordered ‚ÄúMalpuya with Rabri . never tried this combination but definitely would have missed if not tried .

Service:The service here is superb. The staff is courteous and is always on their toes to assist you with everything. They serve with smile and I am definitely coming back here :) |

An Idea | Subhannita Guha | None | 34592825 | 3.0 | 2016-07-10 22:21:22 | This place is moderately well decorated. The furnitures don't match. Ambience-wise, it's very boring. We were the only customers on the ground floor.

SERVICE: Now, whatever I tried to order, they had served the customers just before us and was not available anymore. I was so angry, we only ordered 2 dishes instead of 4.
After waiting for like 30-40 minutes only the burger arrived. Then another 15 minutes for our Caf√© Frappe after we finished our burger!

I LIKED THEIR: Chicken Burger with Mayo Coriander Dip. It was really good. It was more like an Indian Burger with no cheese but masala and chutney and very little mayonnaise. The buns were crunchy on the outside and soft from inside. Surprisingly, they had put capsicum in the burger (and I HATE capsicum) and it went well with the Indian style. The Caf√© Frappe (we had actually ordered cold coffee but then they said we have to order Caf√© Frappe as that's what it is but had still put both of them in as different options with different prices) was good.

I DIDN'T LIKE THEIR: We only ordered these two (as they seemed out of everything we asked) and luckily liked both of them. |

An Idea | Suraj Agarwal | None | 31257225 | 1.0 | 2016-06-11 08:29:20 | Not a good place to be to . The interiors are very boring . The restaurant is also inadequately staffed . We saw a person coming to take order after a long time . Hookah there chokes like anything . Most of the times the staff are busy among themselves . Food is basically amateur cooking . Just ok for a cup of coffee . Avoid otherwise . |
 
An Idea | Murtaza Khambaty | None | 4347171 | 3.0 | 2016-05-28 14:20:49 | Located off Circus Avenue opposite Haji Saheb.

Planned to visit this new place on a Sunday evening. They had promoted themselves on Groupon, now nearbuy, so we had a voucher.

The place is well designed utilising the space available. Well themed to have creative discussions etc. A new concept truly. But the staircase leading to the mezzanine does not go proportionate to the height. I probably bumped twice, bruising my head.

Here comes the worst part.¬†
The manager, not trained at all. Complains started that he cannot honour the deal and the deal with groupon is not fixed and blah blah. He ended up honouring it.
Nearly 70% of the items were unavailable. So we had to be content with what was available. Even in the mocktails a few of them were unavailable. So we ordered from the menu, drinks which were far more expensive. Because of lack of training he ended up accepting the order.
Ordered French fries, Idea special burger, Chicken Sandwich, 2 Oreo shakes (part of the deal worth 300)
And from the menu ordered Idea special pizza as a replacement for an item not available.
Pizza was horrendous. Other items were okay.
And in total i probably had to wait 2 hours for the full order to arrive. Lack of staff and chef it seemed.

The manager ended up by giving me a bill of only Rs.100.
We thought of correcting him, but with the horrible experience, we did not think of paying any extra.¬†
Feel sorry for the owner. |
 
An Idea | Mukulita Ganguly | None | 207896 | 3.5 | 2016-05-14 16:08:23 | 'An Idea' struck us one Sunday evening when we were searching for a nice cafe to drop in. The place is nicely done up, making good use of the space across two floors. It does look like a typical hookah parlour and their choice of loud party music further accentuates the vibe. We were their only customers that evening, and duly chose a couch on the first floor. The woman who came to take our orders informed us that none of the iced teas that we wanted were available, much to our dismay. We finally settled for a Green Apple Lemonade and an Egg Fried Burger. 
The food was served within 15 minutes. The lemonade was a tad bit stronger in flavor than we had wanted but it was refreshing. What stole my heart and changed my feelings regarding that place was the egg burger. Trapped between the mayo slathered burger buns were a patty of potato, a nicely fried egg placed sunny side up, a slice of cheese, onions, tomatoes and slices of cucumber. It was extremely juicy and yummy. The best part was the perfectly done fries. They were hot, crispy and came with some masala sprinkled on top. Together with the ketchup dip, the dish spelled so much comfort. 
I hope the cafe owner makes it a point not to keep half of their menu items unavailable or out of stock and this surely would turn out to be a better place. |

An Idea is the newest addition to the list of upcoming caf√©s in Kolkata but, isn't yet another herd-walker. This caf√©, as the name subtly suggests, is all about coming up with something new. An Idea walks in as an all new corporate caf√© wherein one could peacefully discuss business over a refreshing beverage or some delicious snacks!
Spread across two levels, the ground and the mezzanine, the AMBIANCE spells of a positive vibe and does lift up the mood and aid relaxation. The pristine white walls & ceiling, with business-oriented quotes across, need regular maintenance so as to not send across a negative first. The combination of cushioned as well as leather upholstered seating which could seat around thirty heads added as a plus.
The ventilation needs to be worked upon and the music volumes could be kept low as the loud levels might end up disturbing a corporate discussion. A routine mopping would help upkeep the place. Happened to visit this place for the first time on an Invitation for Food Audit and thereafter have visited it a couple of times.

Coming to the FOOD, the menu on offer was widespread and looked promising enough with a plus of included non-vegetarian fare. But, the dessert options need to be increased. The following was sampled across all visits:

- Blueberry Lemonade
Bottled blueberry crush proportionately used with a well-prepared lemonade. The blueberry flavor was found to be subtle. Could have been a notch higher to give the drink a nice texture & a better taste.

- Pineapple Soda
The drink was just about average and lacked the spot on fizziness. The fruit flavor was found to be too low and the soda had minimal fizz. Has a scope of improvement.

- Caf√© Frapp√©
Frapp√© is a Greek foam-covered iced coffee drink made from brewed coffee.¬† Was well-prepared and had a nice & strong aftertaste of brewed coffee. Served with a dollop of ice-cream on top added as a plus. However, a frozen scoop of ice-cream & a quenelle of whipped cream would have lifted up the level of presentation. Nevertheless, the beverage did taste good.

- Green Apple Lemonade
This drink proved to be a hero throughout. A perfect balance between the flavored crush & lemon juice was struck every time it was ordered. Yes, there were repeat orders. Perfectly done lemonade with the right amount of green apple crush. Tasted refreshing! Highly recommended.
The umbrella straw could be swapped with a lemon wedge for a formal presentation.

- Mix Berry Shake
This drink was a disappointment, mainly because of its disproportionate punch of flavors. The mix of the assortment of berries (read: flavored syrups/crush) failed as the proportion wasn't looked upon. Has a huge scope of improvement. A striking of perfect balance & usage of fresh berries (raspberries, strawberries & blueberries) instead would do wonders. Adding a banana & a well set vanilla-flavored ice-cream to the beverage would take the flavor a notch up.

- Mango Smoothie
A nicely prepared smoothie with low-fat yoghurt, toned milk, flavored syrup & chopped frozen fruit always tastes nice. However, the thick consistency of the beverage was difficult to sip on due to the narrow-mouth straw. A broad-mouth could be better bet. Nevertheless, the beverage impressed. The frozen fruit/coarse crush could be substituted by a ripe fruit in season.

- Blue Lagoon
The drink had a nice balance of Blue curacao syrup, lime & soda. Was extremely refreshing!
Recommended.

- Spicy Mojito
A twist to a virgin mojito was to have the mint leaves swapped with crushed green chillies. The swap was an instat hit and the mojito tasted awesome. Fizzy enough to satiate the bases and spicy enough to leave a nice aftertaste.

- Cold Coffee with Icecream
Failed to live up to the expectation. The coffee flavor was found to be flat and needed to be a tad stronger. Nevertheless, the blend of milk, coffee, ice-cream and sugar was fine. The consistency of the drink could be thicker than served.
The drink as a whole could be improved a lot.

- Hot Chocolate
The mahine-made beverages do taste good but, fail to produce consistency throughout. The drink was thick & extremely chocolatey till the three-fourth portion of the cup. Thereafter, the chocolatey flavor diluted and the drink was too dilute for the liking.
However, a hand-made hot chocolate would always prove to be better! R&D could be done for the betterment of the drink.

- Masala French Fries
Crisp, seasoned & slightly greasy fries served along with ketchup. Was just about average to taste.

- Veg burger
A flavorful, slightly oily & crisp Aloo (Potato) Patty sandwiched along with fresh slices of tomatoes, cucumber, onion & iceberg lettuce inside a mayo-spread burger bun tasted delicious. However, the shape of the bun could have been maintained and the spread of the mayo be restricted to the inside of the bun (and, not to the sides as well).

- Veg Sandwich
Fresh cold cuts (tomatoes, onion & cucumber) sandwiched between two slices of bread along with perfect seasoning were grilled to crispness. Delicious to taste. Was accompanied by ketchup & mayonnaise as dips.

- Idea Special Veg Pizza
The pizza was a bit of disappointment as the base sauce lacked flavors. As a result, the pizza tasted flat. However, the toppings of assorted Olives, American Corn, Pineapple & Capsicum were found to be fresh. The pizza was nicely baked with a generous amount of cheese on top but, the lack of punch in the base sauce couldn't be made up for. Has scope of improvement.

- Veg Mixed Sauce Pasta
Slightly under-boiled pasta (penne) tossed in an imbalance of Arrabbiata & Becham√©l Sauce made up the dish. Due to the imbalance, the rose pink color of the Primavera (mixed) sauce was missed. The Arrabbiata sauce lacked the tanginess it should have, resulting in the overpowering of the creamy texture of the Bechamel sauce making the dish too cheesy for the liking. The pasta as a whole was slightly under-seasoned and was found to have a decent scope of improvement.

- Brownie with Ice-cream
The dessert failed to impress. The plain brownies were stiff, cold & too sweet. Replacing the plain ones for the walnut ones and serving them hot would help re-create this dish in a much better manner. The ice-cream served on top of the brownie was a melted form of a quenelle. Serving it either as a scoop or as a quenelle wouldn't affect much till the time the ice-cream is frozen.
Presented with a generous drizzle of chocolate sauce was nice but, a warmer drizzle would have been much appreciated. Hope the dish is worked upon and the ending is a happy one. 

‚Ä¢ The SHEESHA was found to be smoky and lasted long.

The STAFF conduct was found to be polite and friendly. A shoutout to Asif who catered the customers in the best possible way! Looking at the bigger frame, the staff needs training and also needs to be more welcoming.
The SERVICE is somewhat slow and needs to be worked upon.

The PRICES were found to be inclined towards a reasonable end.

Overall, the experience was nice. 
- Being a new startup, one needs time to settle. This place has a great scope and can do much better in the coming days!
Hope to see An 'improved' Idea soon. |
 
An Idea | Adil Faiz | None | 30736151 | 3.0 | 2016-03-12 18:13:47 | Finding this cafe is very easy because its exactly the opposite of Haji Saheb restaurant  in Park Circus Area...But entering the cafe is a bit tricky somewhat :p.... You need to cross all the muds and stones lying just near the entrance carefully as the KMC work is in progress.... 

Anyways coming back to the cafe, the place looks nice and filled with frames, paintings, etc... The walls are written with quotes... Staffs working here are polite and attentive.... Ground floor is spacious with sofas and chairs... They have a big projector and the best thing about this is you can connect the projector with your mobile phone and when doing  anything on your phone, it displays onto the projector...one can tease his/her friend's by saying "tu mera yeh kaam karde warna tera secret or embarassng photos/videos ko projector mai dikha denge abhi" :p fir kya bechare ko manna hi padega...

For a sports lover like me, my adda is always the first floor because its more comfortable watching the match like being on the balcony of a theatre :D 

V asked for one HOOKAH Pan Thunder flavor.. (hookah was okaay typs)... 

V had their own recipe An idea VEG PIZZA...(pizza was very delicious and well cooked... It was filled with cheese.. The cheese were rolling down on my lips while eating....i loved it... Many people doesn't bother about what  quality tomato sauce its being served with.... But sauce plays a very important role in the taste of pizza, burgers and all in your mouth.... An idea serves the best sauce along with pizza)..

V also had BROWNIE served with vanilla ice cream and dipped in chocolate sauce... ( brownies were a little on the harder side while cutting but the ice cream and chocolate sauce together makes it a perfect taste into the mouth no doubt.... Its nice... 

Lastly v had LEMON ICE TEA..... The taste was just so good.... Everything was well mixed to the right proportion... 

AN IDEA is definitely a nice and suitable spot for sports lover in a pocket friendly way...! |
 
An Idea | Liril Sharma | None | 31697087 | 1.5 | 2016-03-09 10:48:55 | Starting with the bags n loads f garbage which is almost near its entrance will make u feel so not good!!Next coming to the place itself.... the first impression u get will b good only coz the interiors is nt so bad.Inspiration quotes on walls are always good. Coming to the food!Disgusting in one word. Although its nt good to tag so harsh words but really wish could hve helped. Ask food ask drinks all the same and not that its vei much on the economical side,quite standard price and below average stuffs. |
 
An Idea | Avinash Arora | None | 8186961 | 4.5 | 2016-03-09 09:22:30 | Nice cafe. An entrepreneur kind of environment. Cafe is specially dedicated to start ups and entrepreneurs. However, anyone can spend and have a nice time with theirs friends with coffee at reasonable price. I liked the place. |
 
An Idea | Pawan Jaiswal/The Food Crave | None | 73744 | 4.0 | 2016-03-06 13:19:52 | LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION:

3rd visit from Panch Phoron

Filled with restaurants, cafes and fast food joints in the Park street and Park circus area where former places have done well and set them up and new openings are working hard to provide quality and survive.
¬†This newly opened cafe is located at the park circus area just opposite of Haji Saheb and Arsalan near Beck Bagan. Dealing with some fantastic foods and drinks items, they really provide some quality for your taste buds as well as hukkah is also available. Construction is in progress from KMC so it will be difficult for you to get in and walk comfortably.
This was an invitation from the cafe owner itself to our Panch Phoron group for the food tasting purpose.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE:
From the main gate you start to get some positive vibes in you. As you walk in you'll find the place to be big and spacious. Approx sitting of 60-70 people. It has two sitting areas one on the ground which was on the cozy side and another upper gallery which was more nicer and colorful too. Interiors are very eye catchy. Walls and ceiling has wallpapers with different places, people and quotes. Lots of paintings and photo frames has been displayed too. Sitting arrangement is quite decent with comfortable chairs and sofas. Lightnings are quite good. Run in complete air conditioned as well as there is a big projector screen above the main gate. They also got music system installed for your entertainment and better experience, Service is very prompt ¬†and fast. The place is very well managed by Asif (if i remember the name properly). the staffs were sound and very attentive.

FOODS AND DRINKS:
We walked in and took our seats and waiting for the beginning. The menu was quite set before so we were ready for some surprises. We were first greeted with some fine and very well made drinks in forms of Mango Smoothie, Blue Lagoon, Ice Frappe, Green apple, Masala Lemonade and hot Chocolate.
Mango smoothie was very good. It was thick mixed with ice and taste remembered me of eating raw mango. The flavor of mango can be felt in each and every sip thou i found a bit difficult to drag the drink from the straw.
Blue lagoon was very refreshing on the other hand. It was tasting hard and perfect. Few slices of lemon was added in the drink to give a lemon flavor as well.
Green apple was just outstanding. The best drink according to the group for the evening comparing to all the other we had. The flavor make you feel good in each and every sip you take.
Ice frappe looked appealing with the ice scoop over it but it disappointed at the end. it was very thin and taste was absent. Could have been much better.
Hot chocolate looked very good with the choco sauce over it. It was hot and taste was done justice.
Masala lemonade didn't disappoint ¬†as well. Not the best one i would say but was clearly satisfied with the taste and flavor of the drink.

Later we moved on the food items in forms of Egg fried Burger, Veg burger, Chicken sauce burger, Chicken burger, Sunny side chicken club sandwich, veg sandwich, chicken pizza, crispy chilli chicken and mixed sauce pasta.

The description of each and every burger as well as sandwich could be explained in simply one word that is "BRILLIANT".
From the egg burger which consisted of potato, cheese, poached egg with mayonese and lettuce between the bread.
To veg burger which has the stuffed with chicken , cheese, lettuce, cucumber and salty in taste.
Chicken burger burger was good too. The chicken between the bread was made well as well as crunchy,
Sunny side chicken club sandwich had two stuffing with three layers served with mayonnaise, tomato, ketup another was with chicken whereas the third with egg which was simply awesome.
Veg sandwich was made with onions, tomatoes and cucumber. Taste was also decent enough.
Chicken Tandoori pizza was good but was a bit average. The bread was not upto the mark and taste of chicken ¬†in it was too average.
An idea special veg pizza was good topped with corns, capsicum, black olives. thou the bread and the crust was bit satisfactory here,
Crispy chilly chicken was crispy, but the chicken was a bit hard, had to chew hard and more the tomato ketup flavor was coming in my mouth.
Mixed sauce pasta was good till it was served hot and eaten at the same time. the penne was not boiled well so was the complaint from all. The sauces were bit scrambled with the white sauce taking the control of the pasta flavor. Still was good in taste but can be even better.

QNQ AND PRICES:
Quality was very decent and quality was satisfactory too. the chef kept the things intact while making each and every item. Thou some things went wrong but still it can be ignored. Prices are pinched well.

CONCLUSION:
With these kind of burgers and drinks they really impressed me big time. I believe everybody who visit there will be loving the place with their awesome food and fine hospitality. I wish them luck for future and hope them do well in future.

NOTE: this review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place. |
 
An Idea | Snehasis | None | 1142256 | 4.0 | 2016-03-04 19:56:45 | [Intro]

An Idea | Subham Ghosh | None | 2987484 | 4.0 | 2016-03-03 00:53:53 | That horrible situation of being stuck at Park Circus with friends, with the only option to hang out being the very family friendly Biriyani-Mughlai restaurants, now has a solution, which is An Idea. This lovely caf√© has newly opened , just opposite to Haji Saheb, near Meher Ali Road crossing, away from the hustle and bustle of the Park Circus Traffic.

I was invited here with Team Panchphoron for a food tasting session. An Idea is quite spacious, and spread over two floors. While both the floors are well decorated with multicolored posters and photo frames with inspiring quotes, it is the first floor which sort of gives a more cosy feel , and is more suitable for romantic dine out. The seats are cushioned and comfortable. We got seated in the ground floor. I liked the idea of placing the seats at a good distance from one another which will not hamper the privacy of the customers. Also, it was good to find that the cafe hasn't made the most out of its space and has focused mainly on the comfort of its customers.

We were served with gum flavoured hookah which I didn‚Äôt have, but my fellow foodies loved it.

Since it is a caf√©, we sampled a wide range of mocktails:

1.	Blue Lagoon ‚Äì This was a really refreshing drink. Made on soda base, it was slightly frothy and citrus in flavour, with a kick of lime.

2.	Mango Smoothie ‚Äì Even though this drink was made out of rich Mango Puree mixed with milk, it wasn‚Äôt too sweet, just the way I like it. However, the ice cubes weren‚Äôt crushed properly when mixed to the drink, making the texture coarse, and difficult to sip with a straw or otherwise.

3.	Green Apple Lemonade ‚Äì My favourite among all the mocktails here, the subtle green apple essence gave the drink a new dimension. This is a perfect drink for a summertime hangout.

4.	Ice Frappe - The drink was slightly watery and tasted average. Also, the vanilla ice cream topping wasn't a proper scoop. So, it was poor in terms of presentation too.

5.	Masala Lemonade - The masala lemonade was also good and tangy with masala and lime.

We were also served hot chocolate, in the hot drinks category, which was pretty rich, think and welcoming.

We then moved on to the burger and sandwiches section, where we sampled a variety of them. Among burgers, we had egg fried burger, veg burger, chicken burger and chicken cheese burger. All of the burgers were brilliant. The bun was soft and the patty was well-seasoned, soft and moist. The egg fried burger came with a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg, and the chicken cheese burger had a layer of cheese. All the burgers came with tomatoes and lettuce to add some freshness to the protein bases, and were generously drizzled with spicy mayonnaise dip.

Next we had sunny side chicken club sandwich and veg sandwich. Again, both were brilliant. The stuffing of the chicken sandwich with a layer of chicken sandwiched between two layers of egg was heavenly - one of the best sandwiches I had till date. The veg sandwich was stuffed with mashed potato, tomato, onions, etc.

Unlike the Burgers and Sandwiches, the pizzas didn‚Äôt impress us as much. The tandoori chicken pizza was not so well made. The crust was thick and dry. Also, the topping had generous chunks of chicken but the taste was average. However, An idea special veg pizza, which we had next, was better than the chicken pizza. The crust was well baked and not as hard and dry as the earlier one. It was topped with cheese, pineapple, corn, olives and other veggies which tasted good.

The next dish was mix sauce pasta. This was good except for the fact that the penne needed to be a little more boiled and the sauces were not mixed properly in the entire pasta. Overall, it was a good dish but our expectations were a little high after having the burgers and sandwiches.

Crispy chilli chicken was presented to us in a very typical way which didn't appeal to any of us. The dish tasted average as the chicken was crisp from outside but dry from inside.

To end our meal, we had brownie with chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream. This was the most disappointing part of the meal ! The brownie tasted very poor and was not at all hot as it should have been. Neither was the chocolate sauce hot. The vanilla ice cream scoop at the top was again in the form of a chunk and not a proper scoop.

We had a good time but there are a few areas which need a bit of work. The music was too loud. Also, the staff was too miser in providing napkins. Overall, the place has scope for much improvement. Some of the dishes like drinks, burgers and sandwiches were brilliant. The pizza, pasta and the brownie were average and hence need improvement. Also, incorporating some more dessert options in the menu apart from brownie would be beneficial. |
 
An Idea | Tanwyee Ray | None | 402819 | 3.5 | 2016-03-02 23:40:22 | A new caf√© in the city named "An Idea". It's located at Park circus, exactly opposite to Haji Saheb at circus avenue and 2-3 minutes walk from seven point crossing. I was invited to the cafe through 'panch phoron' group. It was a food tasting session on a weekday evening.
    It is an easy find ofcourse but now the entrance is a bit congested due to KMC work.

    The interior is spacious enough with white walls and white tiled floor which soothe your eyes and mind. The colorful ceiling and few quotes on walls here and there breaks the monotony and it will keep you busy. Speedy numbers were being played. It has two floors. The upper one is smaller and very cozy. It is more colorful too. The sofas and chairs were comfortable. It can accommodate around 24-26 people at a time.

  The caf√© serves hookah too but since I don't take hookah, i skipped it.

   First of all, we were served with drinks. We tasted-- Blue lagoon, Mango smoothie, Ice frappe, Green apple lemonade, Ice frappe, Hot chocolate, Masala lemonade.
   Blue lagoon was refreshing with a dash of sourness.
    Mango smoothie was a bit thick, sweet with crushed ice and mango pieces and of course a must have during hot summer.
    Ice frappe served with a scoop of ice cream was not that good. It didn't have right consistency and was too thin and the flavour didn't come out properly.
     Green apple lemonade was again a thumbs up for me. It was tangy, cool and thirst-quenching. 
      Hot chocolate was really good with chocolate sauce on top of it having right consistency. was warm and the aroma and taste will provide comfort on chilly winter.
      Masala lemonade was as usual good and a bit tangy mixed with jal jeera.

   Next we had-- Egg fried burger, Veg burger, Chicken cheese burger, Chicken burger, Sunny side chicken club sandwich, Veg sandwich,Chicken tandoori pizza,An Idea special veg pizza, Crispy chilli chicken, Mixed sauce pasta.
    Egg fried burger was stuffed with aloo (potato) patty and poached egg, cheese and mayonnaise and lettuce. The bread was soft and the whole thing tasted great.
    Veg burger was stuffed with aloo patty,tomatoes, cucumbers,onions and lettuce with mayonnaise and again was great(though veg).
    Chicken cheese burger was stuffed with chicken patty, cheese,lettuce, cucumber and was amazing in taste though slightly salty.
    Chicken burger was good too. It was simple yet awesome.
     Sunny side chicken club sandwich had two stuffings with three layers served with mayonnaise and tomato ketch up.One stuffing was with chicken whereas another one with egg and was delicious though I missed the crisp of toast.
      Veg sandwich was stuffed with onions, tomatoes and cucumbers. Here I loved the crispness and served with mayonnaise and tomato ketch up. It tasted decent.
      Chicken tandoori pizza couldn't impress me much. The crust was thick but hard as a result of which I had to chew hard though and tasted average.
      An Idea special veg pizza was good topped with corns,capsicums,black olives. The crust was soft enough and yummy.
      Crispy chilli chicken was crispy,spicy and tasted good but i didn't like the presentation. 
      Mixed sauce pasta was a thumbs up for me. The blend of sauces was well proportional. Penne need to be boiled a bit more so that it could have been melted in mouth. But the taste was nice.

   For dessert, we had brownie with ice cream. Brownie was cold and as a result it was hard. So it could have been tasted better.
   
   Food and drinks are reasonably priced and service is fast enough. |

An Idea | Joyjeet Gupta | None | 557729 | 3.5 | 2015-10-29 15:29:18 | Located in AJC bose rd near hai saheb this is newly opened outlet is real good.

its a 2 floored cafe,with a nice seating arrangement and quirky wall and ceiling decor and ample space around alongside a big screen to go with ,which I think should be used to screen sports to bring in more clientele.

I tried the combo of Pizza(veg is normally served in the combo, for non-veg 30 INR extra is charged) +Soup+Soft drink along with brownie.

The pizza was nice ,thin crust with a nice layer of cheese and toppings,but the soup was a sadly a disaster,was more of a curry than soup and too much oil quotient, Coming to the brownie,ice cream wasn't available alongside thus we stuck to chocolate.The brownie was on the softer side and not warm,it was not bad but ok.¬†

Service wise they are real good and wi-fi is also available.Since its opened up very recently I'm expecting the food quality to go up.

Its easy on the pocket aswl.TO ZOMATO please update that NON-VEG food is also available here. |

Tried their chicken sandwich and cold coffee once and a combo meal (veg sandwich, omlette, fries, orange juice - Rs 130) the other time, both being good in taste. |

Monkey Bar | Sirsha Dhar | None | 2015246 | 4.5 | 2016-12-15 21:54:11 | My friend, who was leaving the city soon wanted to go out for food and drinks and what could have been better than our decision to hit the Monkey Bar. Finally opened in Kolkata, one of the best-located bar there possibly is. On the 9th floor of Fort Knox on Camac Street, this looks down the beautiful Kolkata skyline with the 2nd bridge, Victoria, St. Pauls church and what not. The place is huge, quaintly decorated with the essential Bong touch both in the menu and the bar. Has an open area with a huge screen. 
For food we ordered the Mobar Caramelised Pork Ribs. Melt in the mouth pork meat. Smoked Chicken, Chicken Salami and Harissa pizza. For drinks we took the Beamer LIIT. Just the right punch of alcohol and tang! Lovely experience. Would definitely like to go back again. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohan Belani | None | 3081061 | 3.5 | 2016-12-15 02:58:39 | The place has a chill vibe . Went with a few school buddies.  There is a open air section as well as an indoor section where you can sit and chill . Drinks were nice . Service could be better . The staff were not attentive enough . Lastly the music . There were people singing karaoke. I mean it's cool to sing and all but we expected some chill music with the setting . |
 
Monkey Bar | Pratik Shah | None | 31614924 | 3.0 | 2016-12-14 13:50:20 | With an indoor and outdoor seating options and great ambience "monkey bar" is sure to impress you . I didnt order much to eat , bt watever i ordered was average - 
Yes it is lil on the expensive side - overall good place to chill once in a while . |

A complete thumbs up .. the only thumbs down would be the quantity  of the food served , it's too little and gives u just a taste of the dish !! |
 
Monkey Bar | Avinaba Das Sarkar | None | 409341 | 3.0 | 2016-12-11 11:02:59 | Went yesterday with a business partner, wasn't really very particular about a place but since it was located near by thought of visiting it once. Few observations

1. The ambiance is nice and the interiors are pretty well done.

2. Music is pretty loud and if you are intending to have a prolonged conversation with someone it would be difficult. 

3. The biggest drawback is the food, we ordered two veg starters since my friend was veg. The quantity and the taste wasn't something justifying the price or the brand. The food was OK but it isn't something one will find difficult to prepare in there kitchen. 

Overall experience was okay since we primarily went there to seat and talk. But comparing the same with the likes to cafe mezzuna or the grid would make this place average at the best. Hope the management looks into it. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rishi Agarwal | None | 1632482 | 4.5 | 2016-12-10 17:02:43 | On the 9th floor at Fort Knox, the newly opened Monkey Bar is a beautiful place to visit. The place offers an unmatched view of the city and the interiors and a class apart which make it one step ahead of other places in the city.
The food on offer is delicious. The mushrooms I ordered and the chilli cheese dragons are a must try for all.
Overall a great new place to visit with a great atmosphere and very polite attendants. |
 
Monkey Bar | TraveKings | None | 29893242 | 4.5 | 2016-12-07 13:14:55 | Located at Fort Knox. It is like Social in Delhi. Good Ambience. Maintaining a Good Standard. Decent Crowd. Decent Hookah & Decent Food. Good Service.¬†2 big screen to enjoy live sports .¬†Little expensive. It will cost around Rs.3000 for 2 person.A Good place to hangout with friends. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sukanya Ghosh | None | 589490 | 3.5 | 2016-12-04 21:24:11 | This one is new in Kolkata, and is definitely pulling lot of crowd. I went there on a Friday evening with two of my friends and it was full of people. Located in camac street, near Urban Desi, not too difficult to locate. The moment you step in , the first thing you notice are the big french windows with a view to die for :), Howrah Bridge and Victoria Memorial at the same, who would not love that!¬†
Now coming to the food, its nothing extraordinary, very mediocre tasting with prices on the higher side. We ordered for 1 mix mushroom bruschetta, mushroom and truffle oil pizza, and tikki of joy (fish). The bruschetta and the pizza was very ordinary, bland in taste I would say. Tikki of joy was definitely good with very subtle flavours, perfectly cooked to perfection.
My rating is truly for the ambience and the fish, anyway one could always try out this place¬†
Thumbs up for the view :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Gunjan Saraf | None | 33964908 | 4.5 | 2016-12-03 14:49:16 | My visit to this place raised my bar of expectations from kolkatas nightlife.. Posh crowd, sophisticated ambience, soothing music, projector screen for matches, good food and superb hukka! The place has it all. We ordered for lebanese platter and cheese spring rolls, both finger licking good! The capuccino cofee was average but the hukka made up for it! A must visit for all the crazy kolkatans looking for a break from chai break! |
 
Monkey Bar | Subham Agarwal | None | 777244 | 1.0 | 2016-12-01 13:05:10 | THIS PLACE IS PATHETIC

I ATE THE PANEER KHICHDI AND I AND MY FRIEND BOTH ¬†HAD A TERRIBLE INFECTION AFTER HAVING THIS. I THINK THEIR COOKING STANDARDS ARE VERY LOW.

WHEN I CALLED THEM TO SAY THAT I HAD A TERRIBLE INFECTION AFTER HAVING YOUR FOOD THEY ¬†HAD NO ANSWER.

I HAVE ALSO PUT UP A COMPLAIN AT FOOD AND QUALITY STANDARDS DEPARTMENT AGAINST THEM,

I SUGGEST NO ONE SHOULD GO THERE AT ALL. |

Food: chicken nachos is a good quantity. Mediterranean platter a lovly combo of flavors n great taste. Pizzas are thin crust n perfect. Drinks are innovative, I tried mamas girl & mojitos. Its one a litl higher side on the pocket but not exorbitant. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sanjiv Sood | None | 186102 | 4.5 | 2016-11-26 07:39:01 | The ‚ÄòMonkey Bar‚Äô Kolkata Avatar is a welcome addition to it's watering hole map and what an experience it metes out! Located in the heart of the city (Camac Street) with a huge and lofty space, it exudes a comfort zone feel. The visual delight of the interior space couples well with a spectacular view of the Kolkata skyline from the restaurant.¬†

The cream de la cr√®me among the restaurant‚Äôs USP's is the outdoor seating arrangement of about 5-6 tables. Although open to air, yet it is air-conditioned to beat the muggier months. Incidentally during the clement months it would be a pronounced experience to soak in Kolkata‚Äôs mild winters. The corner verandah serves hookah for the y-generation and for those who love to smoke with their tipple it is a rather comfortable space. I loved the incipient November chill all through the evening in the outdoor! It would be an idyllic place all through the wintery months to soak in the chilled weather.

Though I am not a cocktail loving person, I ventured out to try some of their swinging concoctions. First shot was the famed Manga.

Sweet and Tangy Vodka based cocktail, it had an all desi flavour burst from the Aam Panna as the main base with its signature cumin flavour to follow. It comes in a kullar shaped glass with etched in a typical Hinglish font that sets the tone for a fusion evening. 
Next, was the more stylized ‚ÄòMad Men‚Äô a Bourbon base with Coffee Orange and a whiff of Rosemary spray, which, I really liked and got myself a double dose.

 
 

Getting headier, I tried out the Copper Monkey, lo and behold but predictably it was in a copper mug. I quite liked the passion fruit flavour and the hint of mint in it worked well.

¬†

Although christened as ‚ÄòMonkey Bar‚Äô one would be rather surprised to see a super array of fusion food alongwith some very innovative desi leaning twisters. One look at the menu and I was instantly attracted to the Laal Maas Phulka Tacos, Radish cake bites for its novelty, Mobar Caramelized Pork ribs for its slow cooking and the Butterfly Chicken for the signature shells. 
The Laal Maas in the Phulka Tacos was juicy and well done, served on a ¬†Bao Stand for appeal as well as to function as a 'hold on'.  The meat was unique in flavour and spiced up enough to support its Laal Maas Status! 

 

The radish /mooli cake bites were indeed a experience though one really cannot make out if radish is used as the main filling ingredient unless told. The Tempura batter and the black bean sauce make up for the frunchy bite and flavour of the Radish bites.

 

The caramelized rib was succulent and smokey, living up the 6-hour slow cooked traditional method. So was it's house sauce quite zesty and lip smacking. 

 

The Butterfly Chicken was perhaps the only dish, which I would give the pass, though a visual delight again. I was lead to believe or was expecting a Butter Chicken filling. Maybe that is a good idea too.

Overall this place is not all just ambience, though that feeling is certainly overwhelming and sets up the mood. The service, food and the liquid chemistry in the cocktails are commendable too.

Monkey Bar | Kaustav Nayak | None | 1276373 | 5.0 | 2016-11-25 09:43:48 | With its French windows giving a glimpse of both the Victoria Memorial as well as the Howrah Bridge, the ambient lighting, great music, brick walls, a gorgeous skylight, a section that projects black and white motion picture and an apparently messy but ultimately symmetric seating arrangement that will please the OCD in you, Monkey Bar is hands down the best looking place in town. The ambiance, crowd and the location itself (9th floor of the Fort Knox building in Camac Street) itself demands a high rating. But it outdoes itself in the food department as well.¬†

The tiger beef is an instant classic. Perfectly cooked and just the right amount oily, this is a dish that I will highly recommend. The chettinad chicken samosas on the other hand flattered to deceive, definitely not worth the high price. Reddy's chicken popcorn though is a whole different story : small pieces of chicken fried with curry leaves, ¬†sesame, coconut shreds and a concoction of south Indian spices.¬†The name that will pique your interest however is the butter chicken khichudi. Bengali style sticky rice cooked amalgamated with Punjabi style chicken butter masala, this is a dish that has sharp flavors very well attuned for the Indian tongue. I absolutely loved it! 4 small cups containing curd, ghee, pickle and papad are given as accompaniments.¬†
¬†

And just everything else, their dessert section is more than competent too. While the snicker bar with its milk chocolate ganache on a crunchy almond base and a chocolate cake below may feel a tad too sweet, they provide a coffee ice cream to go with it and together the balance is delectable. The gondhoraj lime tart was more in my wheelhouse : the tangy lime curd really stood out. If I have to recommend one among these two I'd say take a leap of faith, ditch the always reliable chocolate and go for the tart.¬†

Here's to next time. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pratik Sensarma | None | 10848301 | 5.0 | 2016-11-22 20:50:17 | A too good place to b with your friends...had been there some days before...services are good...and ambience... Wat a place... After a long time had been to such an awesome place like this... One could have a marvelous view of the city Kolkata... Specially our Victoria memorial and cathedral Church...the foods are very tasty ...starting from Manga , tiger beef, tikki of joye to other cocktails  everything was perfectly made and served. Then lastly the desserts...the chocolate cake mainly... Was the best... Really had an too good time..keep it up guys  :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Anusreea Paul | None | 2257306 | 4.5 | 2016-11-21 12:13:39 | The famous brand is finally here in Kolkata. It's been three months since they opened doors on Camac Street and there's been no looking back for them :)
Had the opportunity to visit the place thanks to a bloggers meet. This is the brain child of chef Manu Chandra, the team, the food is crafted by him. The place epitomizes awesomeness in every inch. The place is big, read huge!! The huge old school windows lead you to stare at the city landscape with wide open eyes. They have an open seating arena, high rise chairs and comfortable sofas to choose from. They serve alcohol and hookah. They even arrange for sundowners on wintry afternoons, for you to sip on their lavish cocktails and enjoy the sun going down. The Victoria Memorial and the Howrah bridge are visual delights. They have their pub rules hence it is better to read them up and visit!
The crafted menu for the afternoon:

**Drinks**

Copper Monkey: Served in a copper vessel with a ¬†chunk of orange came this cocktail, whiskey based.

Manga: The ever famous drink, vodka based, a concoct of vodka and mango pulp.

Hipster Smash: Smacking name, and a refreshing drink! The array of colors are incredible. Mix of watermelon juice, a huge chunk of frozen watermelon and vodka.

Old Fashioned on Camac: The name might sound synonymous with rum but it is a whiskey based cocktail.

**Food**

Kerala Red Rice: A vegetarian and a non-vegetarians' delight! Thick red rice mixed with southern spices. It's spicy, it's crunchy, and it's tangy!!

Tiger Beef: The best, best, best beef is served here!! A bowlful of spicy meaty delight!! The shredded, well cooked, perfectly spiced beef served as the best chakna with the cocktails. Quite filling, good in quantity. Must order and highly recommended.

Butterfly Chicken: The outer coatings are designed like butterflies. Fried to perfection, oil less, the butterfly winged shaped cups are visual delights. Filled inside the cups are shredded chicken mixed in a nice sauce. Recommended for the sheer taste, intensity of the dish, and the efforts behind the perfect butterfly wings!

Shammi Sliders: These little burgers are lovely to look at. They do not fill you up completely yet leave you quite satisfied. The minced meat patties are perfect and there's no saucy drips. You actually do not mess yourself up eating this. Accompanied with some house special fries served inside a cute monkey bar wrapper.

Tikki of Joy: Quite a big hit down south, they decided to include it in their Kolkata menu as well. Huge chunks of bhetki frie to perfection. Served with onion rings and mint chutney. Crispy, ample fish in every mouthful, not oily at all.

Lal Maas Phulka Tacos: even sized parathas half rolled like rolls, filled with minced juicy meat. The meat is tender and you would feel like you are eating a roll, Kolkata style!!

**Desserts**

Gondhoraj Lime Tart: Tad a bit too bitter if eaten without the entire chunk. The idea is take a bit of the biscuit base, the creme, the lemon curd, the pistachio cake, and the raspberry sugared petals. And you could keep eating that and stare into the dreamy wintry sky line. But make sure to get a window seat..:)

Old Monkey Signature Chocolate Cake: What is a chocolate if it does not make you high!!! Well, this one sure does...a huge chunk of chocolate bar sprinkled with praline and caramel sauce. Served with a little scoop of ice cream...aaahhh never felt better!!¬†

Guys, agar aap Monkey Bar nahi gaye to please jaldi jaiye...it's waiting for you!! The coolest place in town to rock and roll. Try their karaoke nights or their usual dining hours, you will not be disappointing!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Suruchi Bhawsinghka | None | 1140387 | 3.0 | 2016-11-21 09:59:22 | The amount of tax,service charge vat, and wat not they are adding is insane.I have been to so many resto ,trust me this place is not worth it.I would rather sit in a five-star hotel lounge to spend around 5k between 4 ppl. If you leave aside the taxes you would always want to visit this place .Loved d simple decor(specially the huge windows ) perfect place to chill with friends and enjoy your drink.Snacks are average .Guys pls check ur taxes ...u r being unreasonable !!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Prarthana Roy | None | 1683183 | 3.5 | 2016-11-20 21:42:56 | Firstly , very much overpriced ! But fell in love with their decor and view .. food is overpriced according to their portion and most importantly they don't taste sound to be priced that much ! And coming to tax .. 1000 bucks ?! U will surely be left with a whole in ur pocket .. recommended for once , strictly ! |

Monkey Bar | Dhawal Pratap SIngh | None | 442772 | 3.5 | 2016-11-14 14:34:01 | The place has excellent ambience and definitely scores well on the food quality. However, the portions are really small adding on to the already heavy cost. Instead of 1500 for 2, its a place where you will incur Rs1500 per person. Plus the taxes are a lot on the pocket. Our regular bill of Rs 4800 had Rs2000 worth of taxes amounting to a total of Rs 6800! Paying 40% tax on top of my bill is not something I was looking forward to. |
 
Monkey Bar | Supriya Baid | None | 34842096 | 5.0 | 2016-11-13 20:55:15 | One of the best ambience i have ever seem in kolkata! Fabulous üëå great crowd. Good servers. Well maintained. Lovely presentation of food. Hookah love üíï keep it up guys ‚úå |
 
Monkey Bar | Shruti Keshri | None | 12428511 | 1.0 | 2016-11-08 22:26:50 | Pathetic place, the food quantity is so less, waiters don't understand anything, once you order the order only comes when you die hungry. We waited for  bill for almost 14 mins and then left, the waiter came running out to get the bill, and top of that the bill was wrong, they charged us for we didn't order also.

Over priced, lazy, pathetic place. Never visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | The Calcutta Foodie | None | 36569739 | 4.5 | 2016-11-08 11:14:50 | Monkey bar is the newest attraction in town and rightly so, talking about interiors the biggest hit is the huge Windows showing the skyline of Calcutta, it's a breathtaking view from the 9th floor. 

The menu is quite innovative and the concoctions in terms of the cocktails are pretty darn good.

The food doesn't disappoint at all the butterfly chicken was crispy and juicy which is very rare a combination and the pork ribs had a smokey barbecue flavour to them and were very, very soft. 

The place is slightly expensive, but, with that ambience and quality, it's hardly an issue. |
 
Monkey Bar | Ms_WalkingShoes | None | 1193155 | 4.5 | 2016-11-07 18:24:29 | Read d reviews on Zomato n planned to pop over to dis place.
The interiors..ambience...music..crowd n d staff is absolutely perfect.
The view is jus mindblowing n d breeze is so soothing.
We ordered Prawn Pil Pil which was yum..
The Beef Pickle and the Pork Sausages were a bit disappointing.
We had two beers and a virgin mojito.
D thing dat was bit disappointing was dat our bill was 2368Rs...out of which 535Rs was jus all kinda tax.
Overall this place is one of d best plc to hangout around. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rishav Dey | None | 193398 | 4.0 | 2016-11-07 14:01:53 | Six of us landed up at Monkey Bar on a Saturday evening. It was a nightlife hotspot at 19:30 hours already and we had to wait almost 40 minutes before we could be seated. We were ushered in and given the offer of crowding around the bar which we accepted.
The ambiance was great. Music was good and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Making a conversation wasn't the easiest thing to do but at places like this that is quite expected. 
We kicked off the evening with a portion of Loaded Nachos, 4 helpings of Pack a Punch, one Old Fashioned on Camac with bourbon and one Mama's Girl with Absolut. The last two we had to settle for because Toast to Calcutta couldn't me made due to lack of availability of gin. The nachos were appetizing and I liked my old fashioned with bourbon but the accompanying almond biscotti was too sweet for me. The pack a punch was good but the Mama's Girl was not appreciated by any one.
The Aam Admi Eggs went down well with me. It reminded me of the bhel puri walas and their chutneys. The eggs were soft but firm. It made me crave a bit for the soft, gooey and runny yolk. The Hispter Smash was nice but the Tipsy Sherbet was quite interesting for me because I have always wondered how alcohol would blend with rose syrup and Mo Bar did a wonderful job. The Copper Monkey was a bit like a fruity mint julep but I did like it. The Not so Vanilla was not quite my kind of cocktail with the creamy texture so I exchanged that for the Hipster Smash with a friend. The best cocktail according to me was by far the Mad Men. All the flavours combined really well and complimented each other beautifully. Coffee and orange always work well but the subtle rosemary was a delightful addition. 
The duck pita pockets were great. Oriental flavours in between a pita was an unusual combination but the pita seemed to go quite well with the duck in five spice and the hoisin sauce. The Kerala Beef Fry was nice but I would have loved to have it with Malabar parotta instead of the bread they served. The smoked chicken pizza was decent too. 
The service was very good. There was a period in between when we were very unhappy with the excruciatingly slow service but our server was extremely apologetic about it and cited the reason of a busy weekend evening for the barmen. It was understandable as far as I was concerned. The value for money is perhaps a bit on the lower side and I would say Mo Bar is a moderately expensive place. The food was mostly good. The drinks too were mostly very good. And I couldn't get enough of the Mad Men. So I will return for the Mad Men and to try the beef bulgogi, tiger beef, Goan chrizo pav, baked brie and prawn ghee roast. Recommended if one doesn't mind spending a bit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sharan Bansal | None | 394157 | 5.0 | 2016-11-06 18:14:14 | Amazing new York style ambience in Kolkata. Great hospitality and service! We had an awesome Sunday lunch with friends over champagne , rum punch and beer ! |

Monkey Bar | Harsh Agarwal | None | 615445 | 4.5 | 2016-11-03 22:40:49 | Food, decor and ambience is top notch. Kolkata has got a Gem restaurant and bar. The view and seating is made for each other.

For the egg lovers-"Aam aadmi eggs. Sheer brilliant dish. Must try if you visit.

The staff needs to be a little polite and polished. Lack hospitality and softness. If they can improve upon this, it will be no doubt the finest joint in the city.

Will surely visit again. |

Monkey Bar | Rahul | None | 20537314 | 4.0 | 2016-10-31 13:45:15 | Great food, smooth shisha and pleasant staff at a great location. The food served was fresh and tasty. Though the open area for shisha is a little congested. This is a perfect alternative to bar exchange since the staff is very pleasant. Had an outing with 8 of team mates on October 25, costed 7.5 k excluding alcohol. Will be my preferred location for after work outings as long as the staff is pleasant. |
 
Monkey Bar | Pooja Marwaha | None | 1981882 | 4.0 | 2016-10-30 23:11:30 | One of the new places opened in Calcutta. This place has a great view of the city with good music. When I say good music, I mean music in the background and you can hear the person sitting opposite to you. The service is spot on. The servers attend to you first and do not chit chat in a corner. Now the food, ordered a farmers pizza which was good enough for an evening snack. The best thing that happened during the evening was the hookah. It was so smooth yet gave the kick. After a very long had really good hookah. The price pinch is moderate too. Would definitely visit more often now. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Agrawal | None | 1902980 | 4.5 | 2016-10-30 00:43:02 | Since its opening, have been there couple of times already. The evening view of the city is definitely one of the the ups of the place.¬†
The ambience is awesome and the right kind of classy touch interiors makes you want to come n relax with friends.¬†
The mocktails were good, and some dishes mentioning special mention are Chilli Cheese dragons, Med platter, Falafel Sliders and Mobar Laksa.¬†
Thanks Avantika for bringing the Monkey to town. :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Divya Khettry | None | 1930204 | 4.0 | 2016-10-29 12:09:30 | Finally the Monkey swings East! Must day amazing ambience and view. Drinks were great too the only thing I didn't like here was the food its a little average. I also loved the music all my fav tracks were played. |
 
Monkey Bar | Tushar Goyal | None | 1881622 | 4.5 | 2016-10-29 10:47:35 | Unluckily I ended up to the place on a Thursday and it was a dry day there, but the food was phenomenal . The moment you see the menu you want to try everything .

We ordered loaded nacho was very good , beet and orange salad which was ok , kimchi baby potatoes is a must try.
For the mains I ordered paneer kichdi which was good and the soulful bowl chilly paneer was good too. 

Going to go again for the non- veg very soon . |
 
Monkey Bar | Komal Agarwal | None | 34017613 | 3.5 | 2016-10-27 19:38:37 | The only good part about this place was the ambience and picturesque settings. Food is nothing worth mentioning. The spaghetti pasta was bad. Spring rolls & nachos were okay. Among the drinks, I really liked the Virgin Mangaa. |

Was there for lunch.ambience is very good and the moment I entered it felt like its a lovely place for a winter lazy afternoon date. very clean.As we went in a large group the service was a bit slow.I hope as the restaurant ages it will be sorted out.butter chicken khichdi was good.smoothies and drink were also good.I had tried prawn which was also very tasty.I loved the interior,very classy specially the open area to sit.should try once.

Monkey Bar | Chandramouli Daga | None | 15803042 | 4.0 | 2016-10-24 20:41:36 | A sensational space with a terrific view of the Calcutta skyline. While it is expensive and the cocktails might not cater to everyone, the food is experimantally delicious while the service is admirable. 

Happening! And how! |
 
Monkey Bar | Moumita Das Talukdar | None | 343640 | 4.0 | 2016-10-24 20:01:03 | Visited this place at Fort Knox building 9th floor- the new outlet to party with friends. Gorgeous interiors and a stellar reputation as a chain we went there with high expectations and we were satisfied.Spectacular view with good music and awsum food. Innovative cocktails , lipsmacking pork and beef dishes.A must try joint. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anurag Jaiswal | None | 1778047 | 4.5 | 2016-10-24 18:14:19 | Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox building. The food & service are excellent. Ambiance is awesome. Per pax-Rs.1000 with drinks (inclusive of taxes) |
 
Monkey Bar | Sanjay Bhowmik | None | 29528004 | 4.0 | 2016-10-23 23:36:21 | I think I would rate this place 95% purely for the ambience and the view....the truly quintessential bar and cafe where you can have an awesome conversation at an awesome side table with an awesome view of the metropolis named Kolkata that I am yet to see anywhere in this city....truth be told, I was bedazzled and enamoured by the view....a whole 6/5!!!

Then comes the hard reality....for the few drinks (7), couple of coffee and a few bites, it was almost ‚Çπ4.2k....time to pay for the view!!!!....maybe a tinge more so 3.5/5....but the few hours spent are worth sitting there provided the company / conversation is good....

Nothing to write home about the food taste, just an avg 3.5/5

In the evening they have a good lighting set up and inspite of the crowd, every table and it's occupants had their own space and not intruded upon....it didn't feel cluttered like other such hallmark Kolkatan joints....would have gone for a 4.5/5 but they totally managed to screw that up with thumping music, which could have been easily done through the softer and low volume lounge music!!!...killed the evening ambience....if the idea was to attract the vibrant gen then they missed the fact that there were a whole lot of couples and a few bunch who were engrossed in their own conversation and seemed a bit irritated with the thumping bass....so here's a 3/5 for ruining the awesome layout and view....

If I would ever come again, it would be for the view and the window seats....but guys, do get some class in the music, the environment should provide for individual space, the layout, lighting, setting and ambience are awesome but your music settings are truly questionable, at least this time round!!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Gupta | None | 29595954 | 3.0 | 2016-10-23 14:58:41 | I didnt have the food since i wanted north indian cuisine and they dnt serve the same where as Zomato says they serve north indian.... ambience was excellent.... |

Monkey Bar | Munmun Banerjee Ghosh | None | 13780291 | 5.0 | 2016-10-21 09:22:56 | Excellent food!Good cocktails.Even better music.And the best part of Monkey Bar is the view.Perfect blend to fall in love with the city,all over again.Must-visit!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sunanda Ghosh | None | 2720210 | 4.0 | 2016-10-20 12:21:51 | The newest addition to Camac Street, Monkey bar holds the promise of becoming one of the coolest hangouts for GenY. Situated on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building, it offers a panoramic view of the city through huge glass windows and what's more there's even arrangement for outdoor seating. The decor is charming and an awesome background score makes the ambience perfect for chilling out with your friends over great food and drinks. Firstly we ordered a butterfly chicken and duck pita pockets. The chicken was delicious and crispy tossed with bell peppers, chilli flakes and stuffed in crunchy butterfly shells and the duck meat marinated with spices and packed inside soft pita bread created fireworks in our mouths. We also went for a smoked chicken, chicken salami and harissa pizza which was superb, to say the least. There was another Hearty bowl, a heartwarming chicken broth with bean sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, flat noodles and bokchoy sprinkled with chilli oil. We finished off with Mobar Sundae Sandwich, an ice cream cake with nuts layered with nutella and tutti fruti. We also tried their hookah and the shisha is really good and strong. The service is more of less..efficient and the staff polite..but the pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side. They recently acquired their bar license, so would love to drop in again for a taste of their cocktails! |
 
Monkey Bar | Pamela Nandi | None | 2821382 | 3.0 | 2016-10-20 01:06:16 | No doubt this place has an amazing ambience with an indoor and outdoor seating area styled in the form of british pub, but food and service is very very poor.¬† We went on ashtami night with friends, they took about an hour to prepare the chicken stacked as saslik to grill it. Once served, the dish was just tasteless. |
 
Monkey Bar | Sunrita Sarkar | None | 804376 | 5.0 | 2016-10-18 22:44:36 | Hi, if you love Calcutta , good music(and by good music I mean led zeppelin and pink flyod and classics as such ) and a brilliant view of Calcutta, this is the place to be. 

We ordered a pack up punch, Sangria and a 100 pipers based cocktail. All three were pretty different and pretty well made. 

We didn't order any food as we were so engrossed in the decor and view. 

The hospitality was brilliant. 

Do give it a visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Aritra Roy | None | 145459 | 4.5 | 2016-10-17 22:31:23 | Already visited twice in such a short span of opening its doors in Kolkata, Monkey Bar has been fabulous on both occasions. Situated on the top floor of Fort Knox, it provides a magnificent view of the Kolkata skyline with Victoria Memorial, St Pauls Cathedral, Hooghly bridge and the 42 which is the tallest building here.

The food has been great and is presented in a unique way. Ordered Chilli Cheese dragons, Mac and cheese croquettes, Butterfly chicken and Chicken Chimichurri on the first time along with Mangaa mocktail. On the repeat, we ordered Mobar caramel ribs, Tiger beef, Reddys popcorn chicken alongwith a Smoked chicken pizza. In drinks, we had copper monkey , house made ginger beer with a couple of KF ultras.

However special mention must go to the desserts, Snicker bar is just too good while Nolen gur creme brulee was delicious.
They have a small open air area for hookah as well. The service is prompt and the ambience is quite relaxing. The bar looks pretty while the music changes over time with comforting tracks during evening to partying ones as the night progresses on.

Overall, the Kolkata gastropub scene is proud to have Monkey bar in its lineup. Hope it gets better from here.Cant wait to visit soon again :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Rupsha Bhadra | None | 606325 | 4.5 | 2016-10-16 14:33:22 | Monkey bar in Delhi is a location that is a part of some very special memories so I had really high expectations from its Calcutta counterpart. It certainly did not disappoint. We ordered loaded chicken nachos, the butter chicken kichdi, smoked chicken pizza and others. The butter chicken khichdi was really impressive. So were the cocktails Maanga and Copper monkey. A little on the higher side when it comes to the pocket pinch, monkey bar did live up to all the expectations. And the view is just fantastic. |
 
Monkey Bar | Madhurya Sarkar | None | 6309371 | 5.0 | 2016-10-16 12:11:35 | Just loved it.
The ambiance, the playlist, the skyline view, the staff management, the food and everything is just superb of this pub. This is located in the 9th floor of Knox building opposite to Urban desi. We visited late afternoon but the best time would be to hit this place in the evening. This can be an ideal place to go a date with your partner :)
The view of St. Paul's Cathedral, Victoria Memorial and Hooghly Bridge adds flavour to their ambiance.
Coming to food we had kingfisher premium beer, chicken wings and chocolate lava cake. All of the dishes were value for money. Overall had an excellent experience.
Coming back soon :) |
 
Monkey Bar | Syed Murtaza Jafar | None | 32607152 | 5.0 | 2016-10-16 04:52:57 | Ok, so same night we visited The Great Booze Story and Monkey Bar, and I'll say Monkey Bar won big time. Just opposite Urban Desi (will visit soon), good collection of music, courteous and attentive staff, this is one venue that you would want to visit again. The ambience, the view of the The Victoria Memorial is just a sight to look at. Safe to say, I'll be coming back to this place soon |

Monkey Bar | Rashmi Adhikary | None | 31014016 | 4.5 | 2016-10-14 14:26:12 | We visited Monkey Bar on Saptami evening, and had a spectacular time. The ambience is lively, the music is great, the decor very impressive and the service commendable.  
Now coming to the sumptuous meal; an assortment of drinks - whiskey, tequila, rum, virgin mojita, espresso -  was ordered with starters being Butterfly Chicken and Chicken Chapli. Yes, Butterfly Chicken is a definitely worth a try. In the main course, there was Aunty Vinnie's Berry Pulao. Tiger Beef was so delicious that two more dishes were ordered; this is must-try for beef lovers. This is the first place in Kolkata that I see so many beef dishes being offered. Galouti Killer was the other beef dish ordered and equally palatable. I had Mee Goreng which is an Indonesian dish of spiced noodles and got it topped with chicken. 
Overall, it was a great experience in this newly-opened gastropub. |
 
Monkey Bar | Piyush Dalmia | None | 15726652 | 4.5 | 2016-10-13 20:42:49 | Another fab newbie in the city

Talk about the Ambience, Food, Service or the Decor, it excels in all

Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building at Camac Street, it offers a spectacular view of the city
 
The Decor and Seating Arrangements are well made 

They got a separate smoking area which is quite airy, and has ample seating space as well

Shisha was pretty decent and lasted quite a while

Now lets talk about the protagonist here

Nachos were crisp and loaded with cheese, the Platter was appealing and featured variety of items whereas the mocktails were on fleek 

But things which really caught our attention were Spaghetti and Paneer Khidchi

While the former was extremely tasty, the latter is a MUST have dish for sure

All in all, it was a happy dining experience for us |
 
Monkey Bar | Arpita Agarwal | None | 998579 | 4.5 | 2016-10-13 12:39:47 | A new place in town, much awaited. Great ambience! The view is also super!! Maybe they should have had a slightly larger rooftop area. Food is decent too. The nachos were pretty good. The Manga is a must try!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sharmistha Mukherjee | None | 722185 | 4.5 | 2016-10-12 06:49:58 | If you are in Calcutta and love the skyline and a few drinks to go along with it on a hot, rainy or crisp evening this is the place to be. Monkey Bar in Calcutta is done up beautifully and affords you a view of the Victoria Memorial, St Paul's Cathedral and the Hoogly Bridge. The have cocktails and food over and above what they offer in other cities. The hipster smash is delicious to say the least. As was the bourbon cocktail with almond bitters... |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohit Suryawanshi | None | 36318376 | 5.0 | 2016-10-11 18:11:29 | My favourite lalmass Takos ,Pizza and Delicious Chillie cheese Dragon.
The friendliness of the staff seems genuine. I have never seen such good customer service as I experienced. |
 
Monkey Bar | FOODBUFFS | None | 987893 | 4.0 | 2016-10-11 11:16:14 | Visited on Ashtami night.Even though it was a good crowd,we managed to get a table immediately,courtesy to the experienced and efficient management team.There is an open-air seating which mainly caters to people ordering hookah or going there for a puff.Indoor seating is quite large.
Decor is akin to a British pub.Upholstery is comfortable.What allures you are those French windows through which you can catch a great glimpse of the city skyline,from the ninth floor.In the evenings there is muted lighting.Ambience is quite good.We heard some good old day soft music but as the night grew,the DJ started giving groovy yet classy numbers.
Service is warm and polite but there was a lack of professionalism.We were giving the same food order to two or three different men at times.The servers,even though quite courteous,were not quite clearly conversant about the food and beverages,unless asked upon.Details or any recommendations/suggestions were not given on their own.They need to more vocal  and well informed about every detail of the food when the order is being placed.
PAN RASNA HOOKAH-strong flavour,no choking but the smoke was quite weak,unlike to our liking.It was smooth but the smoke didnot last for an hour.It wasnot worth the price charged.Not satisfied.
BUTTERFLY CHICKEN-tastewise quite impressive.Chicken morsels were soft and had a sweet tangy taste.The sauce was pretty good and spicy and the butterfly shells were crispy,the whole presentation looked lovely.Three butterflies were there.
REDDY'S CHICKEN POPCORN-Well this dish took us to South India.Moderately sized chicken morsels deep fried in a batter having a crisp crunchy texture and the taste was so consistent in southern flavours,it tasted good.Curry leaves flavour was predominant and we liked it a lot to go for a second order.
CHICKEN CHIMICHURI-Chicken was soft.They were skewed up but the flavours were quite bland,didnot stand up to our expectations.Not impressive at all,this dish needs improvement.
MEDITERRANEAN PLATTER-Mixed comments.It was great in some parts,not so great in others.Chickpea fries were not so good to taste,seemed a bit too fried where the chickpea stuffing was too less.The pita breads were nice,soft,fluffy,buttered and nicely grilled,tasted good.Hummus was in great quantity,tastewise perfect but the babaghanoush didnot stand out in taste.Cheese filo wraps tasted good.They  had soft spinach with gooey cheese inside wrapped in rice papers and fried.Overall a good dish,you can give it a try if Mediterranean cuisine is your calling.
OLD MONK(EY) CHOCOLATE CAKE-Good.Cake was melt in mouth soft and creamy.Consistency of cream was smooth,light and fluffy.The dessert was classy,superb and hence recommended.
Foodwise we were not that satisfied as much as we were with their cocktails!!
Their BOURBON LIIT,MAD MEN and MAMA'S GIRL were just bang on!The bartender did a great job.The blend was great,the liquor gave a great kick,courtesy the good mixing.They were well balanced in flavours and the ingredients of the drinks very well complimented each other.Spices and mint went well with vodka,and coffee with whisky surely made a great pair.
We also ordered Heineken,Ginger ale and fresh lime soda which was usual.
As far as price is concerned,it is too high for the food and some cocktails! Quantity of food is very less,so doesnot justify the price and tastewise it didnot make a good mark.The cocktails had a price tag which was same as most gastropubs having a good establishment cost,yet they were high.
This pub is a must visit,esp for their awsome cocktails.The gastronome part needs improvement to call it a fair gastropub.Will visit again for sure owing to the overall good experience that we had,a good hangout place and to try other cocktails and entr√©es. |
 
Monkey Bar | Garima Poddar | None | 2714062 | 3.5 | 2016-10-10 23:22:48 | The ambience n decor is nice..I had ordered fr a peach icetea n it was quite refreshing..the chilli cheese dragon was nt that impressive n lacking chilli..onion n capsicum basically the description was amazing bt it was no where near that..nachos was average..spaghetti in red sauce was again average..green thai curry was really nice n d best part was d dessert mobar sundae sandwhch it was like love at first bite |
 
Monkey Bar | Rohit Misra | None | 1561408 | 4.5 | 2016-10-10 11:32:08 | Monkey bar has lived upto the expectations. With crazy ambience and amazing service, it just became my favourite destination in town. Also on a special note, Ripon out there was brilliant with his service. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rima Dhara | None | 1796261 | 2.5 | 2016-10-09 20:08:51 | Nothing great... service is very bad... food is ok.. ambiance is good ... but as a whole coz of service of of the worst place I have ever been.... will not try again ‚òπÔ∏è chicken wasn't fresh... very bad experience ... |
 
Monkey Bar | Sreyashi M. | None | 10853321 | 4.5 | 2016-10-09 19:05:16 | Visited today for lunch, and a had a lovely time! 
I suggest you get a table by the windows. The Kolkata skyline will definitely make your visit even more memorable. 
We tried the Maanga cocktail (5 stars, peeps!) with the Tiger Beef. I suggest you try both. Succulent meat with the zing of your drink makes for some very happy (read: tipsy) people. 
For mains, we tried the Mobar burger and it was heavenly! The Naga pork soulful bowl was fabulous too! Portions are great, flavour is gorgeous and staff is super sweet and nice. 
I hope you maintain what you've got going so I can visit again! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sudipto Mitra | None | 2401672 | 3.5 | 2016-10-09 09:00:39 | Nice decor , awsum view of the cityscape and great cocktails . Food is good to average with a twist and may not be liked by all.
We ordered pitchers of pack a punch,mangaa amd mohjito and the first is the best.

We stuck with finger food only and ordered 
Mushroom bruschetta(good),prawn pil pil(gr8), chicken churi(avg) and tiger beef(gr8)
Rounded everything off with aunty berry pulao which was delicious
 This a typical gastro bar with foot tapping music which is too loud at times, we had to ask it to be turned down.

The service could have been bettet and there  was confusion while seating. We were waiting at the bar for our table to be ready but some other guests jumped on that

Oh forgot to mention a outing here will surely burn a whole in your pocket |
 
Monkey Bar | Vedant Kabra | None | 2240676 | 4.5 | 2016-10-09 08:47:40 | I went to monkey bar last night and I was pretty surprised. Read all the reviews and thoroughly analysed the place in my mind before I went there (it's what I do). 
The guy at the front desk (I believe he was the owner) was phenomenal. So welcoming, so easy going and so 'approachable'. The one at the front desk is the face of any restaurant. He told us we'll have to wait for 40, but we got a table in 20. Told us we'll have to share the table - but eventually we didn't have to. 
I think seating right outside the kitchen + bar worked for us. Didn't have to wait for the food (the cheese drum, nachos and mushroom + truffle oil pizza are INSANE). Ordered quite a bit on the liquor front - barring the martini everything else was really good (fun presentation too!) (including the ginger beer). We had heard so much about the desserts - total let down though (chocolava cake with mint ice cream was terrible I must confess - Mezzuna gets the big ups here). 
The staff was pretty alright (looked a little confused at times). 
Monkey bar must work on guest management (but it is only a few weeks old so it's okay). Thoroughly impressed with the ambience (trumps Mezzuna and all the other hot spots in the city several times over), food, booze and service. 
This place has my highest recommendation. |
 
Monkey Bar | Argha Basu | None | 1892606 | 5.0 | 2016-10-08 15:46:45 | If you want to impress your girlfriend or wife . Just take her there . Take your seat next to the glass wall and enjoy the panaromic view of the Victoria memorial, Vidyasagar Setu and the Howrah Bridge.

Monkey Bar | Puja Das | None | 36272619 | 4.5 | 2016-10-08 12:52:12 | Bookmarks . ¬†It's got an amazing atmosphere with outdoor and indoor seating. Despite going on the weekend it gets the right amount of crowd that makes it a very happening place. Music was really good. We wanted to try a new cocktail, so we went for the ¬†toast to calcutta which was a little different and tasted quite good. Food on the other hand was quite unique. 
service is also impressed us. ¬† ¬†

The place is a little hard to find. But overall it's a nice place for the weekend chill! |
 
Monkey Bar | Tejash | None | 15384381 | 1.5 | 2016-10-08 11:33:48 | Visited this place on 7th October with friends. We were a group of 11 but there is no place for such big group there.  The table we were given was ideal for 7 but we had to squeeze in.  Repeated request for chair felt to deaf ears till such time my friend pulled up the bar chair from the adjacent table. They have limited staff and one server was alloted to the tables.  Needless to say the service was pathetic and totally unacceptable. Our order for beer and ginger ale took 30 mins and after repeated reminders it arrived.  The food is average with limited option for Vegetarian. No one wants to eat "baigan pakora " or " vada pav" at such a place.  We were charged for one item that was ordered but not served. On pointing the same the server "argued" that we didn't realise but it was indeed served to us.  In no mood to hang around any more we just paid and left.  While waiting down for our car we met others who too were very disappointed with the place. 

This will be one of those places in kolkata that will soon be ticked off based on word or mouth and customer experience because of shabby service and attitude of the people who run it. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anshuman Jalan | None | 31752408 | 2.0 | 2016-10-08 00:20:08 | Good atmoshpere ! Average food for vegie lovers ! Place to chill and soak in the music and buzz around . Nothing home to write about the food . And weekend and holidays . aVOID as unable to give service due to rush |
 
Monkey Bar | Darshana Rampuria | None | 2855224 | 3.5 | 2016-10-05 11:34:14 | So finally visited Monkey Bar ! The ambience is good as compared to What we get to see in Kolkata.. but apart from that nothing spectacular and surely cannot be compared to the one in Mumbai ! The food is Too average . We had ordered the Nachos - this one was a disaster , pesto spaghetti ( penne pasta wasn't there!!) - yet again very bland and just not up to the mark . Though tempura and mezze platter was good BUT the Coconut ice cream Dessert was FABULOUS SO an extra 0.50 points for that !! Food needs to be worked upon , staff is courteous ! Best wishes .. hoping my next visit be better and with no complains ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sujan Das | None | 36218418 | 4.5 | 2016-10-03 14:04:44 | I went this place with my friends and I would say this was amazing and was full packed in the weekend without liquor. There ambiance was very good and the music they place is also very nice . There drinks where also very good . They smoking and non smoking area also which was the best part of this place. Good place to spend with your friends. As we been to many other bars but I love this place as they have place to sit and there service was also excellent. They where pack but still there people know how to attend the gust which was very good in this bar. Pocket friendly and staff was excellent smiling and they working and they suggest also if you are new to this place and don't know what to order. I would suggest everyone for this place and sure you will be in love with this place. I basically tried everything on the menu (food and beverage), and yes it is all worth every penny
, I m fan of there menu and food, really enjoyed.¬†

Monkey Bar | Soul !! | None | 32140714 | 4.5 | 2016-10-03 08:50:51 | In a word, wonderful. We been to Delhi Monkey but this is the best one with wonderful view. 
One thing we really missed the Foosball) 
But no matter we had great time, fantastic food, we order lot many things forget the name but pizza and starters are yumm, drinks are also really nice
Staff were very welcoming too.

So keep good work guys !! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sarat | None | 8743511 | 3.0 | 2016-10-03 01:16:59 | ambience is good.. was excited to reach the place.. view n open air is also impressive.. u get a glimpse of the Victoria memorial
Although can't talk about the cocktails(coz we wet on 2nd oct, dry day), but we had the copper monkey mocktail and a ginger beer, we were very happy with both
But sadly food was extremely disappointing.. taste as well as quality is not upto the mark.. ordered the much talked about chicken butterfly, too sweet, no flavour of chicken n tasted Lyk beans on toast
Second ordered the spicy tomato spaghetti, worst I hav ever had, tasted like Maggi with tomato
Butter chicken khichadi was good,,, good innovation
Snickerbar, dessert, was well mind blowing if u hav a sweet tooth.. very nice and balanced taste
But the whole dining experience was not satisfactory |
 
Monkey Bar | Nikita Ramgarhia | None | 903737 | 2.5 | 2016-10-01 10:11:42 | An over hyped place.
The only plus points are the ambience and the service.
The hookah is average and food simply disappoints.
The vada pao is good.
The Mac and cheese croquettes have peas in them..like who does peas with cheese and Mac..
Too bad with the experimentation guys..
And the potato rackett is also very bland.
Galauti is average..
You guys are better in other cities I have heard..so pls improve in Kolkata |
 
Monkey Bar | Bindu | None | 36159071 | 3.5 | 2016-09-29 00:55:19 | At last chef manu chandra with his concept of monkey bar has entered in Kolkata.but sorry to say the food and service has dissapointed on comparison with the monkey bars in bombay and bangalore.
Need to check before its too late its my first experience but once more will love to try so that they can still improvise. |
 
Monkey Bar | Harish Todi | None | 1076456 | 2.0 | 2016-09-28 00:28:12 | The place is worst ever in all places that I do visit. What it seems from outside is not at all from inside. It's totally a different one and thats very disappointing for me. The hookah was so bad that I just left it after once. It was all a waste of money for me and that too a huge waste as it is very costly as per their brand name , but it's sad to say that it couldn't carry it'd brand name at all. |
 
Monkey Bar | Hardik Daga || Kolkata Epicurean | None | 9516701 | 4.0 | 2016-09-26 23:52:06 | Location-Fort knox building(9th floor),Camac street.

Finally "Monkey bar" has opened its gate to kolkata.After establishing itself in Mumbai,Delhi and Bangalore its opening in kolkata was much awaited.This place is totally a fresh take on gastrobar culture.As we entered we were totally astonished with the beauty of this place.The best part about this place was the swanky interiors and the dazzling view.The menu was mouthwatering and creation of one of the finest chef Manu Chandra.But along with whole lot of positive aspects this place has its negative side too and that is its service and price.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is extremely calm and soothing.The interiors are extremely high-toned.The place is divided into two sections(Smoking and Non Smoking area)which is appreciated.And atlast for this segment,we can bet that this place has the best view in comparison to any of the eateries in Kolkata.

Service-We were extremely disappointed with the service at this place.The staff was extremely confused with our seating.They took about 15 minutes to make us sit and also the table on which we were seated was already reserved by someone due to which we have to change our table in between.We also have to urge them many a times to serve us water and take the order for the food.But on the other side we saw that the staff was trained very well with the dishes and helped us to choose the right dishes according to our starvation.

Food-The food at this place was good in taste but what astonished us the most was their presentation,it was just praise-worthy.We had-
1:Med platter
2:Spicy panner bhurji buns
3:Chilli cheese dragons

Among them our favourite was "Med platter".We also had sheesha at this place which we find extremely expensive.It cost us around 800+taxes.

Food-4/5
Service-3/5
Ambiance-4.5/5

This place is a must visit for experiencing its Ambiance and food oresentation.üòÉüòÉ |
 
Monkey Bar | Ritwika Pal | None | 172912 | 4.0 | 2016-09-26 10:27:27 | Woo another gastropub in town, I was super excited to explore this new place. Unfortunately they not yet started with alcohol. But yes for compensation they have this Non alcoholic beer in their menu card. Which is more like a ginger ale.¬†
Food is awesome we tried Sticky Korean Chicken Wings and Prawn Pil Pil for which is can give 5/5. |
 
Monkey Bar | Manish Jhawar | None | 2238114 | 4.5 | 2016-09-26 00:59:53 | Different menu........v gud ambience.......gud view.........gud food!!

Monkey Bar | Vikash Kumar Singh | None | 32056738 | 2.0 | 2016-09-25 23:21:32 | Went to this place on 25th of September. The best part of this hotel is the view of Victoria + Vidyasagar Setu. Food is ok types. Service needs to improve. Didnt like that much. |
 
Monkey Bar | Shakshi Bajaj | None | 34222951 | 4.0 | 2016-09-25 21:50:03 | Had recently visited the place.  Ambience was really good.  Soothing music and ample space worked well for me.  All the people were very courteous and response was very quick. We ordered nachos,  potato with rachlette cheese and pizza.  The food was yummmm. We asked for out of the menu toppings for pizza and they were more than happy to serve.  It was a pleasant experience. |
 
Monkey Bar | Samrat Banerjee | None | 984442 | 3.0 | 2016-09-25 18:48:36 | Visited the place on 24Sep. A mix of pro's and cons. Remarkably expensive, considering service is yet to reach premium standards. Yet to get a bar license, staff seems confused about where to seat you if you walk in as a couple. While the outdoor sitting layout is nice, it's primarily used as a hookah space by boisterous youngsters, and the seating layout is remarkably cramped. Service also is a minus here with the server not asking or serving water if not called to do so. Portions are quite small against the charges. Chicken Chimichuri was good, folks lovers which was 3 cutlets of bhekti coated and fried was ok. The mushroom pizza was definitely a let down. With 2 soft drinks the tab came to ‚Çπ1650+. Not worth a revisit soon. |
 
Monkey Bar | Abhishek Agarwal | None | 2897244 | 3.5 | 2016-09-25 03:13:53 | Was on the bucket list since it opened... So
We ordered a hookah but it failed my expectations... We tried out the tacos which was really nice... Service was on the slower side.... Definitely a lot to improve..
But then having ur food wit hookah nd Victoria memorial to look over.. The view is breathtaking..
But u need to live up to the name...
Hope to b back soon.... Nd wish to see a Better Trained Monkeyüëç |
 
Monkey Bar | Santosh Singhal | None | 27588565 | 5.0 | 2016-09-24 22:50:00 | An excellent place The sitting arrangement nice with a separate hukka place is very good 
The choice of menu is very good Everything is so so good & has a perfect taste According to me this is the first place where I did not have to add anything Desserts r very good Good Sevice Keep it upüëç |
 
Monkey Bar | Avijit Biswas | None | 1095896 | 4.5 | 2016-09-24 13:18:25 | Kolkata welcomes Monkey Bar with whole hearted love and appreciation... and they deserve it... no doubts about that...

Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox, Camac Street... and I will suggest everyone to go there during the evening... you guys will get mesmerized with the view of our City of Joy... I bet no other gustopub have such plus point till date in Kolkata... they have an excellent intero which you can enjoy anytime... also the outdoor seating is pretty attracting...

The service was top notched... and the staffs are very courteous too...

Now coming straight to the food and drinks...

Monkey Bar | Shourya Sengupta | None | 2357486 | 4.5 | 2016-09-23 21:51:57 | Brilliant food! Loved the wide choice of meat. Please keep up the good work! Look forward to having the Galouti Killer, next time since it was not available. |
 
Monkey Bar | Siddhi Newatia | None | 3761881 | 3.0 | 2016-09-23 21:24:05 | Amazing ambience..very spacious, drinks menu could Hav had more variety..hated the mangaa drink..i found it too sour..the pizza and chilli cheese dragons were good. |
 
Monkey Bar | Harsh Bathwal | None | 1481844 | 3.5 | 2016-09-21 23:42:47 | Visited here for the first time. The food menu is different from what you come across usually in other restaurants. I think it's a perfect date spot as it has a beautiful Victoria building's view which looks amazing at night. Also the music was superb.
Pocket pinch : 600-700 per head. ( Food and mocktail) |
 
Monkey Bar | Shikha Ojha | None | 2112728 | 4.5 | 2016-09-18 01:48:05 | Amazing decor and awesome food. They had an outdoor sitting too which had a big screen playing Mickie and Minnie black and white cartoon synchronized with the songs being played. The cost is on the higher side but if you want to pamper yourself or people you love, this is the place to be. The amazing view is icing on the cake. |
 
Monkey Bar | Utsav Agarwal | None | 31137221 | 1.5 | 2016-09-17 22:49:13 | There is a difference in Bangalore wen it compares to Kolkata one , seriously don't no d reason but it needs to upgrade it very soon as in Bangalore. 
Specifically, the property is pretty old for a brand like dis 
According to me Monkey bar is just not another lounge but a more of a culture which in itself |
 
Monkey Bar | Arnav Jhunjhunwala | None | 22857974 | 5.0 | 2016-09-16 21:28:37 | The best place to hangout now. Food quality is excellent and many of the dishes aren't available anywhere in Kolkata. The key lime pie is unbelievable and a must have each time you go. |
 
Monkey Bar | Tanya Sen | None | 496614 | 5.0 | 2016-09-15 00:44:28 | The moment you walk in to this restaurant you're going to notice the long french windows and ofcourse the most beautiful view which includes victoria memorial. The ambience is lovely, very warm and urban. We ordered Aam Pannas, Tiger beef, Prawn Ghee Roast, Pepper Calamari. All of them were to die for. For dessert we ordered Nolen gurer creme br√ªl√©e. Yumm yumm!! I would totally come again. Loved itüòä |
 
Monkey Bar | Sourav Mukherjee | None | 306717 | 4.5 | 2016-09-14 11:38:19 | Finally they have arrived in Kolkata after rocking Delhi , Mumbai , Bangalore etc. and a few of Corporate Monkeys could muster the courage and had enough stock of lame excuses (for residential purposes only) to visit this joint on the lazy Saturday afternoon last week. Very conveniently located at Camac Street , innovative food & drinks menu like Kerala Rice , Butterfly Chicken , Prawn Pil Pil and many more.¬† Personally I loved the ginger beer. It was a full house and it is nice to see that City of Joy has lapped up the Monkey Bar and the legendary versatile gastronomical journey of Kolkata has just added yet another feather . Must visit joint for foodies and a great place to unwind. Wishing luck and Highly recommended !!!! |
 
Monkey Bar | Siddhartha Chowdhary | None | 211170 | 4.0 | 2016-09-14 00:31:42 | Dim lights and chic interiors. A totally fresh take on gastropub culture. The place was almost full when we entered so 9 of us had to accommodate on a smaller table. They weren't serving alcohol today, and for the next few days also they are keeping the bar closed. we had to compromise on that and had to order the virgins. We had the much hyped 'maanga' which was nice and refreshing. Homemade ginger beer was good. Brownie cookie shake wasn't available. For starters we had chilli cheese dragons, cheese filled cigar rolls with spicy garlic sauce, the sauce was amazing. Rock Corn tempura was good, crisp and the teriyaki sauce was appropriately done. Loaded nachos was amazing. Potato with raclette which was fried potatoes topped with stringy mozzarella cheese, was basic and slightly spiced toped with pickled jalape√±os. We also ordered two types of pizza , roasted zucchini with parmesan and tomatoes and the other, mushrooms with truffle oil. I loved the mushroom one over the zucchini one. But the pizza looked a bit messy and wasn't also evenly crisp. Overall the service was spontaneous and amiable. I liked the overall experience though. |
 
Monkey Bar | Rahul Chopra | None | 34103337 | 4.5 | 2016-09-13 20:44:04 | Monkey Bar is a grown up version of a slightly more casual neighborhood bar. With about 300+ gastro pubs in India it is only a matter of time when people start aping. The Calcutta version is setting it apart from the rest of the so called gastro pubs.

We had the good fortune of going to the private opening of Monkey Bar Kolkata on the 1st September, 2016. It was a small party for about a 100 people. The mood was up beat and there was a sense of relief and satisfaction on the staff who were hosting us. It has taken Monkey Bar Kolkata a little over 8 months to complete the restaurant.

The staff is from all across the country. This makes for some good interaction with them ‚Äì that is if you care to chat them up. The cocktails are more involved. There is reasonable work that is done to create the drinks behind the counter. Work as in ingredients have been mixed and labor have been put in to create a concoction or mixes. Not just opening bottles and squirting premixes in a shaker and serving things up. Almost like an artisan touch. The bases are fermented in house; you can see the large glass jars filled and sitting happy on the bar counter.

To begins with the view is something you must visit let alone anything else. Add the food and you have method to mayhem. The care that goes in the food here is evident when you have your first bites. With Chef Manu Chandra at the helm of the kitchen things are definitely going to have certain standards in terms of flavor and quality. There is always going to be a reason behind why what ever has been done to the food in the kitchen here at Monkey Bar.

Expect massive flavors and good service. In fact it is so good to see the city opening up to the kinds of Monkey Bar. This is a place where you can come in and kick back with friends on a weekend. This is one tree that we two monkeys are happy to call home. |
 
Monkey Bar | Jayeeta Basu | None | 360426 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 21:01:52 | So finally Kolkata gets Monkey Bar!! 
I have always loved the Bangalore  and the Mumbai Monkey Bar because of the ambience.  
First day, the space and the view is amazing!! They had a very limited drinks menu considering first day. I had Toast to Calcutta, Manga and Copper Grin. Toast to Calcutta was refreshing, adding smoke gondhoraj lebu,  it tasted even better.  Manga is something I have drank before.  Copper Grin was okay. 
Let's get into the food menu.  Prawn ghee roast,  Vada Pav,  Keema Pav the menu took me back to Bombay and South. 
I had the Korean sticky wings,  since I already came to Monkey Bar  after having dinner,  I sticked to one starter and drinks!
I am planning to head back to Monkey Bar pretty soon for full fledged meal and lot of Toast to Calcutta! 
Please stock the bar as it is extremely disappointing to come to Monkey Bar and sit with limited choices in terms of alcohol. |
 
Monkey Bar | Arushi Dhupia | None | 1597321 | 4.0 | 2016-09-12 19:14:22 | Monkey Bar is on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building on camac. Visit in the evening and if you're sitting by the window panes, you can see the Victoria Memorial, lights twinkling from The 42, and the outline of a part of the Parama flyover. It's so cool! 
The music is good and the place has a very funky feel to it. The food is good, not excellent. 
Loved the pizza and the Med platter.  Corn kernels were okayish. 
The Loaded Nachos were Brilliant!! Lots of sour cream and Mexican beans and fully loaded as the name suggests! No other places in kolkata (apart from the Big Nachos at |
 
Monkey Bar | Shhashee Churiwala | None | 2053496 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 23:48:39 | The newest hub in kolkata with different design and fresco depicting old kolkata. The giant size windows showing the serene skyline of the city. Exhaustive menu with both indian and international cuisine with a twist. Prompt service , great tasting dishes both starters and mains accompanied humble pricing. A great place to kill your hunger. All in all good experience after a long time. A must visit. |
 
Monkey Bar | Aihik Barua | None | 1850614 | 3.5 | 2016-09-11 22:10:16 | This review might change. This post is influenced mostly due to the nonavailability of alcohol , and I did see two or three bottles of liquor , anyway , about the interiors and location , bloody superb amazing selection , love it , would suggest it anybody , the bartenders ( coke tenders üòÇ) seemed cocky , but it's a relief to see a high end restaurant serving beef, that's fresh and the it was good actually , would go again for the booze ! |
 
Monkey Bar | Mansi Tulshan | None | 33240285 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 21:17:40 | Went there in the evening today to check out all the hype surrounding it. Guess what! Wasn't disappointed at all. We took a seat right next to the window(yes, I have a fascination for tables next to Windows) and was mesmerised by the breathtaking view of the city. The music, ambience were perfect for a chilled out evening with a great date(note:my husband).
The lemon iced tea was very good.. Perfect in taste. The staff recommended ' the med platter 'as a great vegetarian option and we decided to try that. The platter had falafel, pita pockets, cheese and spinach filos, and the usual dips. The hummus was great and we were serves a hearty portion if it which made us happy coz it's the dips which usually are heroes of this dish. The babagonoush was great and it had a smokey taste which was really good. The curd and cucumber dip definitely needs improvement. It was runny and tasted like buttermilk! Had no taste and we left most of it. The best part of the ambience was hookah had a separate enclosure and wasn't served inside the main restaurant! Will definitely return to this place for a relaxing evening! |
 
Monkey Bar | Sajid Feroz | None | 60540 | 1.0 | 2016-09-11 17:20:01 | New place and pathetic service....guy at the reception refused to give a table coz I was alone and suggested a table outside in open when it was so  hot outside.After a while I was a given a table with no seat n ws suggested to stand n eat (brilliant!) Although after some protest a seat was provided.i even noticed couples were asked to share a table even when some of the tables were empty ! It was quite bizzare !! imagine going on a double date with some strangers ! It was like they just wanted to give table to group of 4 or more ,again like I said restaurant was not even full!

Food was served ..I ordered a prawn dish ,peach ice tea and the snicker bar for dessert.prawn dish was good ,the ice tea wasn't served n after 45 minutes of ordering I was told it's not available .the snicker bar was good (recommended) !! Some how all the servers were lost in their own world ,roaming around in groups n hardly paying attention to customers ..that too when there was no rush at all ! 
 
I am not tat critical while writing reviews but m quite surprised how casual the staff was while handling their customers (that too being a new place in town).I have been to monkey bar in Delhi and tat place is amazing ! 

Service - 0/5
Decor -4/5 (lovely view of Victoria memorial n hoogly bridge ) 
Food - 3.5 (would love to explore more) 

Must have - the snicker bar |
 
Monkey Bar | Aadarsh Agarwal | None | 1183989 | 4.5 | 2016-09-11 17:18:45 | The ambience and location of the place was top notch. With the bar not licensed yet the food surely compensated. There is a separate outdoor section for shisha takers. Lastly, the view of Victoria was the cherry on the cake. |
 
Monkey Bar | Reevu Wangdi | None | 284286 | 5.0 | 2016-09-11 00:42:46 | Great place to chill & dine... best thing is they serve beef...Tiger beef was succulent and spiced to perfection... Korean bulgogi beef rice was flavoursome ... chorizo pork pav was delicious... ampanna done right... and service was tops... gonna be back when the bar opens ..I believe next week it is... good going .. |
 
Monkey Bar | Devanshi Powani | None | 33090142 | 3.5 | 2016-09-10 23:54:27 | The snicker bar desert and the Aam aadmi eggs were the highlight of our dinner. Can't wait for the bar to start . Loved the service and the ambience. |
 
Monkey Bar | Jashita Ray | None | 589467 | 4.0 | 2016-09-09 19:52:29 | Had been waiting eagerly for the opening of Monkey Bar and there I was dragging my fiance, paying a visit in the first week itself. However I would say i rather got slightly disappointed. The staff seemed amateur. They were very amiable but highly confused. Firstly it took them over 20-25mins with repetitive reminders to serve us water. And further disappointment was on asking for the drinks menu, they informed us they didn't have license for alcohol. Thus we had to settle for mocktails. The person who took our mocktail order was so confused. He was unsure of the mocktails on offer, we had to specifically cue him with names like green apple or blue lagoon etc. And oh, there was no paper napkins, spoons and forks or sauces kept on the table for us as some had mentioned in previous reviews - we had to ask for them. Probably they don't have them kept in advance in the open air section.
Now the good part - Everything else!
The ambience - Wow. The view of the Victoria Memorial is simply stunning. You can just sit and spend hours adoring your surroundings.
We ordered a teen paan hookah, along with a Virgin Mangaa- Loved it and a Green Apple Soda which was decent, not that great. Next on our list were the Butterflies, Rooster Booster Burger & Chicken 65. The first two were mouthwatering, especially the burger - juicy, filling, yummilicious. And then the cherry on the pie - the dessert - Snicker bar- I genuinely recommend this. Loved the way they serve it and the taste is heavenly.
Overall, had a lovely evening with the MoBar Mojo! Just wished I could give it a 5 star rating. |
 
Monkey Bar | Luna Chatterjee (Madly_Food_Lover) | None | 1304639 | 4.5 | 2016-09-09 01:36:56 | The Monkey has finally swung east, and that too it's making it's presence felt !! After Mumbai and Delhi now Kolkata hasit own "Monkey Bar". 
To start with It's an amazing property that has a breathtaking view. You can just gaze at Kolkata skyline while sipping some amazing cocktails.
Curated by acclaimed chef Manu Chandra, Monkey Bar's menu boasts of innovative food and drinks. I absolutely loved each and everything that i tasted but some of the items and drinks need spl mention.
Kerala Rice Salad- A salad made with wild red rice, blended with herbs and topped with curd chilli, the dish is indigenous and light.
Med Platter-A dish which is a visual delight in itself apart from being a total amalgamation of fritters and dips.
Tikki of Joy- A perfect dish to satisfy the bong fish craving.
Butterfly Chicken- Chicken blended with herbs placed inside a butterfly shaped shell.
Prawn Pil Pil- Perfectly prepared Prawn served with bread. Simple yet delicious
Laal Maas Phulka Tacos-Rajasthani laal mash intelligently placed inside tacos, a perfect fusion food.
Spare Pork Ribs- This is ansolutely recommended for those pork lovers. The meat is tender and cooked to perfection in barbecue sauce.
The drinks served quenched our thirst perfectly, among them some needs spl mentionlike Manga, Copper Monkey, Pink Punch. 
The desserts are absolutely delightful.Gondhoraj Lemon Tart is sweet, with a bit of tang!! There is Snicker Bar whichbis total bliss.
So with the coming of Monkey Bar i can safely say that gastronomic revolution has indeed hit our City of Joy. |
 
Monkey Bar | Anamitraa/The Gut Filling | None | 671420 | 4.0 | 2016-09-09 00:46:21 | The City of Joy is witnessing a major change in the gastronomic culture post the technological revolution of smartphones and wireless technology. There has been evolution of the global food and Calcuttans are gradually getting used to it. After many multinational and national pubs coming to Kolkata, it was the turn for Monkey Bar to refresh Kolkata with its gracious presence.

This 3rd September, I was invited to the Pre Launch of the Kolkata Chapter where the #MonkeySwungEast. It was a lovely happy afternoon where all the foodies, bloggers, critics and experts had a gala time with beautiful cocktails, mocktails and great good.

The place is located at the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building in Camac Street. Blessed with a wonderful view, you can see the Victoria Memorial, St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral and Hooghly Bridge altogether. We had to pick up paper pieces with names of cocktails and sit at the assigned table to participate in games and quizzes. It was a lot of fun. Ambience is all classy with the bar and high chair along with couches. I loved the wall art on the gateway to the open air sitting area which is done with Gupi Bagha, Tana Rickshaw and all the nostalgic memoirs of Kolkata.

The food was equally good. There were many cocktails and I, being a teetotaler had the virgin versions of all the drinks. Some of them were great, actually. We had ‚Äì

Kerala Red Rice Salad - Baby spinach, red rice, raw mango, coconut, peanuts and upmensinkai (salted chilli from Karnataka). I generally do not eat chillies, but this one was so good. Loved it a lot.

Mac & Cheese Croquettes ‚Äì Golden fried broccoli and peas along with chilli mayo and salsa. I am a fan of cheese. So the croquettes were really admired.

Med Platter - Falafel, spinach, cheese filo parcels, hummus, smoked baba ganoush, roasted peppers, olives, with pita bread and labneh. The presentation of this platter was really an eye catching one. It was really good.

Smoked Beetroot and Beans Galouti - Melt in mouth vegetarian galouti on saffron laced taftan, onion and mint chutney. This dish too was okay.

Baked Brie ‚Äì Oh! I loved this dish. Brie cheese with filo surrounded by pineapple salsa. The cheese oozing out of the pastry created all the sensation. Loved this dish a lot. Had a huge share of it from my table.

Prawn Pil Pil - Tossed in olive oil with chilli, garlic and parsley. It was served with garlic rubbed toast. This was extremely delicious. Loved the dish a lot specially for its aroma and the garlic breads, specially.

Tikki of Joy - Kolkata inspired Bhetki fish cutlets with kasundi, fennel seed & coriander, served with mint chutney. This is one classic dish which no Calcuttan will ever fail to love. I was no exception.

Tiger Beef - Slices of steak tossed with chilli paste, black beans, galangal, ginger, bean sprouts, lemon, bok choy and peppers. This dish was a bit spicy, not suited to my taste but loved by my fellow foodies at the table.

Butterfly Chicken - Sweet, spicy, crispy bits of chicken tossed with sesame, chilli, honey and peppers; stuffed in our signature butterfly shells. The butterfly shells resembled to a savoury treat from the lands of Andhra Pradesh, popularly known as Phoolbu. This dish was unique, in presentation and taste.

Laal Maas Phulka Tacos ‚Äì Who doesn‚Äôt know about this classical delicacy of Rajasthan? Monkey Bar has successfully fused this Indian beauty along with Mexican Tacos. This twist in the cuisines creates the beauty of the culinary culture and here lies the skill of a chef, who is an artist in this case. Loved this dish for the innovation.

Spare Pork Ribs ‚Äì Trust me, it is the best pork dish I have had till date. The pork was so soft, juicy and tender that it literally melted inside the mouth. It was tossed in a tangy and sweet sauce which was really good. Writing the review after 5-6 days but I still can‚Äôt get over the beauty of the pork ribs.

Gondhoraj Lime Tart ‚Äì This was one unique dessert we have tried there. Lemon curd, torched meringue, lemon & mint gel, pistachio cake & cookie crust ‚Äì combination of all good things at one go. Loved the refreshing vibe of this dessert.

The Snicker Bar ‚Äì I am not a big Snicker fan. But this dessert along with the perfect swirls of the s‚Äômore has become one of the desserts to crave for at the strangest of times. Milk chocolate ganache, dark chocolate micro cake, hazelnut praline cream, salted caramel gel being the composition of this dessert, I loved it till the end.

Drinks ‚Äì Copper Monkey, Manga, Pack of Punch, Toast To Calcutta, Mad Men. I was in Team Copper Monkey. Had the virgin version of all the drinks. Liked the Manga to be the best, which they claim to be one of their signature cocktails along with Copper Monkey, which was also very good.

I would like to thank the nationally acclaimed figure Chef Manu Chandra to spend and share his valuable words about food and Team Monkey Bar for having us over and presenting a lifetime of memories. Best wishes to the team and may they prosper ahead. Happy Dining! :) |
 
Monkey Bar | The Hungry Desis (Ramya & Chiranjeev) | None | 30569103 | 4.5 | 2016-09-08 16:29:59 | Monkey Bar has finally come to the City of Joy and promises to be a perfect place to have fun and relax. When we walked into the gastropub, the first thing that came to our minds was "classy and quirky".¬†
The best of it all is the stunning view.  You have a clear sight of the St. Paul's Cathedral and the Victoria Memorial in the distance. The service staff are swift and attentive.
 Another thoughtful design is the assortment of condiments and cutlery set on the tables. You can use them as you like instead of calling for the servers everytime. The cocktails are innovative, using a variety of ingredients and the food is lip-smackingly delicious! Our recommendations are the Mangaa and the Tipsy Sherbet among the drinks. With regards to the food, the vegetarian dishes are as good as the non vegetarian ones. We suggest the Med Platter and the Baked Brie among the vegetarian choices. For the non-vegetarians, the Prawn Pil Pil is a must try. To achieve full satiisfaction, do sample the Snicker Bar..it is to die for! |
 
Monkey Bar | Varnika | None | 380228 | 4.5 | 2016-09-07 10:06:59 | The wait is finally over. The moment you enter Monkey Bar, you get the feel of the one in Bangalore. The open air area is simply amazing, the view of Victoria Memorial is breathtaking. 
I loved the ambience of the inner section as well. Even though it has some basic monkey bar elements missing the place is great overall. 
We ordered the MoBar Classic Chilli Cheese Dragons which were to die for. 
For drinks we had the Copper One which was quite bad. It didn't taste of Alcohol at all. 
Taste of Calcutta was refreshing and nice. Pack a punch was also decent. 
All in all once they start functioning full time and properly it will be a great place. Super excited! |
 
Monkey Bar | Roli Vajpeyi | None | 909801 | 5.0 | 2016-09-06 23:07:49 | Monkey bar finally opens in Kolkata! You guys are in for a treat the cocktails are so unique and nice you can't just order one! And the snacks are just awesome. This is my new hang out place. The desserts specially the snickers one is just amazing. |

Saldanha Bakery | 18224075 | (22.5557437485, 88.3580046147) | https://www.zomato.com/kolkata/saldanha-bakery-wellesley | ['Bakery', 'Desserts'] | 


Saldanha Bakery | Kankana Chatterjee | None | 7888 | 4.5 | 2016-12-18 23:51:54 | Its a very old bakery in a lane on Rafi ahmed Kidwai Road. Recently tried their rich fruit cake and the famous walnut cake. Both are rich, moist, soft and mouth watering and melts in your mouth. Never had something so delicious in any other cake shop/bakery. Can't wait to try the savouries they had to offer. |
 

----------------------------------
Saldanha Bakery | Shaurya Pathak | None | 367302 | 4.0 | 2016-12-17 21:09:23 | It will be a time taking process to find this place. But it will test your resolve for the love of food.
Don't look around. Just look down and enjoy the lip smacking goodies. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Kashif Ahmed | None | 1115831 | 4.5 | 2016-12-14 19:10:28 | Surprisingly, this joint serves the best Walnut Cakes i have ever tasted in my life..... It is a very old bakery.... The patties is also lip smacking....
Strongly recommend the Walnut Cake, try it once....But kindly refrain from taking your vehicle as parking is a serious pain..... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Amrita Mondal | None | 36255179 | 4.0 | 2016-10-28 21:36:46 | The best bakery in town for traditional Christmas goodies like fruit cake, walnut cake, plain butter cake, plum cake, Brownies, tarts, etc. It is a place where bulk orders are taken generally. It is not a shop or a cafe. It is a bakery where you order stuff and take away. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tuks4 | None | 36484659 | 4.5 | 2016-10-25 00:29:07 | ive been an indirect customer of this bakery for a while.. my sis's school orders their items regularly and i get to taste them too :)
this time though, i went to the place & had my own order.. a good number of chicken & corn envelope & choc truffle cake, both eggless & w/ egg..

my 1 line verdict.. the BEST bakery in the city.. period. in terms of taste + price + raw materials + the care + the old-school process, this is without doubt the best place in Calcutta.. & i repeat CALCUTTA and not kolkatta or kolkutta or some other rubbish misnaming this city gets !
this is the place that makes proper patties, proper macrones, cakes & pastries.. almost all of their items taste uniquely clean & refined.. and someone with a decent palette, will feel the 'non-commercial' taste as well..

i had a client team visiting from Poland who were extremely happy eating these items..¬† chicken envelope is their costliest item @35 a pc.. v filling yet flaky & light.. the choc truffle cake melted away inside the mouth.. super soft !
ul see amul butter being used to fry the onions.. pure almond crumbs being used inside the cake's base.. egg whites been beaten for 30mins until those nice soft peaks show up.. no wonder the taste is superlative !

few downsides to mention.. the cheese puff is not good at all.. slice cakes are sometimes stiff.. the place can do better without being that cluttery.. someone with a nose for hygiene might not be thrilled with all the 'hands' being used.. but i guess that too is their USP at some point :) |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anushka Agarwal | None | 34748091 | 3.5 | 2016-10-24 11:21:12 | Been to this joint lately and loved their brownies and cakes. They are freshly baked and delicious both at the same time. Usually if you go to this place during late evening you'll miss out on most of the stuffs. Pre-ordering recommended. ‚úåüèªÔ∏è |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Debadyuti Karan | None | 5018051 | 4.0 | 2016-08-30 22:52:05 | Kolkata is full of sweet surprises. Who would ever guess that an old yellow house in central Kolkata houses one of the best bakeries in town?! A cake lovers paradise, this bakery is famous for its weddings cakes for the Anglo Indians. Good things don't come easy; one needs to make an effort to relish their creations. A pre order is a must at this 80 year old bakery. While most of their stuff is good, the must must must on the order list would be their almond cake, coconut macaroons and their soft moist dark brownies. If you are lucky and drop by you might find some' bakes' of the day that you could pick up. Debra Saldanha one of the daughters now runs the place and maintains the high quality standard set by her parents. The place is not a fancy store. They know their quality is far better than most bakeries in town and they let their baking do the talking. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Rajtilak Bhattacharjee | None | 68484 | 5.0 | 2016-08-20 22:28:12 | The best bakery in Kolkata. Must try their almond cakes, macaroons, and chocolate fudges. You can pre-order, although there is no home delivery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Indrajit Lahiri | None | 542545 | 4.5 | 2016-08-02 16:47:16 | There goes around a story in Kolkata gastronomic circuit that the best traditional l anglo-Indian cakes are found not in fancy hotels, but in few homes, and over the period of time, they‚Äôve become legends. Many have heard of the name, but few have actually been there, the name‚Äôs Saldanha Bakery and Confectionary

One should reach Rafi Ahmed Kidwai road (the tram road) and find out the B C Sen Jewellery shop on it. While in the afternoon, the traffic moves towards north, it comes on the right hand side. Take the adjacent lane and after 50-100 mtrs, you can find a yellow house on your left with Saldanha written on the outside wall. Parking is a big big problem. Hence, either take your driver or take your two-wheeler. The house, at any point of time, smells of vanilla essence, and once you enter, you feel like magically you‚Äôve been transported in the old laid back,colonial Calcutta. There‚Äôs a big queue whirling up the staircase, but not shoving or cursing each other. Mostly because, the clients here are mainly regular ones and the owners know them by name‚Ä¶.. Welcome to Saldanha- arguably the BEST traditional bakery and confectionery in Calcutta.

¬†

They‚Äôll be slightly surprised if you ask them for the menu card. Normally people go there and ask them what‚Äôs the pick of the day and happily take it away. Items are damn reasonably priced, so nothing to worry about. Take their crossed buns to start with. The cherry stuffed crossed buns are a treat to the sore eyes and love for the morning tea. They‚Äôre extremely heavy and at 19/- a piece, a steal. Next, if you‚Äôre lucky enough, Ms Debra Saldanha would have made those heavenly Macroons and you‚Äôd may like to collect a few at 20/- a piece. They say, its like making love to someone, if you take your first bite on a good Macroon and you may find the relevance here.

¬†

The next item has to be their Almond cake. I was told that their chocolate walnut cake is also great, but that day, only Almond Cake was done and it was the softest, creamiest cake I‚Äôve ever tasted in Calcutta. The standard size is at 160/- and its a steal. You may trust me and take 2 pieces of the same without thinking. Stuffed with lots of chopped almond, its pure heaven. On request, they slice the cake, which I feel is a good option.

¬†

During Easter (this time of the year), they also make some Easter Eggs at 350/- and 650/- depending upon the size (cashew-marzipan eggs stuffed with home made chololate). Also, smaller eggs (100 & 150/- a piece) are made with solid chocolate and for a choco-lover, they are seriously sinful.

¬†

All said and done, while coming down, you‚Äôd may like to have a peek inside their drawing room and trust me you‚Äôll find a mess with food items thrown on everything, which personally I liked. The wood-fired bakery is in the ground floor and is worth a glance.

¬†

Enjoy the cakes, the true old fashioned soft tea cakes and dry fruit cakes. I was told they make seriously good non-veg sandwich and cheese puffs, but that‚Äôs another story. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Tisyaketu Sirkar | None | 3479861 | 5.0 | 2016-07-14 13:57:20 | This may be a controversial statement, but I think saldahnas is hands down the best bakery in Cal. From their savouries to their pastries and cakes - everything is absolutely delicious, maintaining a consistent level of quality. A special shout out to their brownies, which are the best I have ever tasted. The exterior of the brownie is slightly hard and crumbly, while the inside is gooey and moist - an absolutely perfect combination. Another item I must mention is their chocolate truffle  cake which easily supersedes all it rivals, striking a perfect balance in terms of sweetness. This is a  place you must visit if you have a sweet tooth. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Sumit Surai | None | 11641 | 4.0 | 2016-07-13 22:52:39 | This amazing bakery is a hidden gem. Tough to find out for the first timers, but once you locate the place and taste their cakes, you will have to return, again and again. The Saldanhas operate from their home and it is a take away place. Most items are made to order. But all of their cakes taste awesome. I specially love their walnut cakes. Must try place and absolutely worth travelling for and the pain of locating the place for the first time. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Arjun Kumar Roy | None | 33434945 | 5.0 | 2016-05-18 00:48:34 | Its an amazing bakery where we get great some authentic baked products. Please try their cakes, mousses and other stuff... Its one the oldest in our city and serves you upto your expectations... |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Anwesha Ghosh | None | 14295941 | 3.5 | 2016-02-12 19:26:47 | One of the oldest bakeries. Very much similar to nahoums but couldn't overdo it.
My mother brings home a few of its cakes and other things whenever she visits. 
Today was such.
Cheese puffs horrible. I'll recommend to avoid that. 
However, the other savouries are real saviours. Vegetable sandwich has the perfect blend of mayonnaise. The slice cake was good too.
Worth a try as it keeps up to the old culture of Kolkata. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Jude Martin | None | 1895578 | 4.0 | 2016-01-26 23:48:16 | Saldanha bakery has been the oldest and most well known bakeries in Kolkata where cakes are made with pure taste and proper ingredients which differs them and separates them from the rest of the old bakeries in Kolkata .
The cakes made over here are always enjoyed by people who love cakes and want  different flavour's in the city of joy , as you come across those regular bakeries with lavish and full decor but they miss out the special and most important part which is a signature ingredient that only is done by certain bakeries to maintain their heritage business in full swing.
This year I ordered a few cakes for Christmas from here and i wasn't dissapointed with my decision as all my guests and friends loved the nice yum preparation done of which i was totally happy, then the pricing is also pretty good as for the quality they keep, so no problem that way and the location is very well known which is a very good thing.
Ending it I would say I m looking forward in trying many more varieties of cakes and eatables available here in the coming days so I have great expectations from Saldanha bakery. |
 
Saldanha Bakery | Suhail Hassan | None | 684685 | 4.5 | 2016-01-26 15:28:43 | Well well well.....this place is truly one hidden gem...how come I never knew about this place even though I stayed so close to it....my bad....when I came to know about this and all good reviews I had to visit this place....finding this place was not a tough thing though...its more of a home bakery thing and the setup looked like they take private bulk orders....I bought 1 lb of walnut cake and few chicken sandwiches...I have no words to describe...it was the best walnut cake I ever had till now...truly 5star standard....and the chicken sandwich was also really good...I cudnt get anything else from there as all the items were over...they are well known for their puffs too...would try every item they make....the best find in zomato till now...
A highly recommended place for cakes....

Tried their chicken envelop and cheese puff...the envelop was awesome...the size is also bigger than those famous bakeries like kookie jar n cakes and also cheaper than them and also tastes better than them too....u have to warm them little bit in oven at home to get the best taste...and so was their cheese puff really cheesy....
****will keep on updating my review as I try their other items**** |

Kafe 6/2B | Piko Biswas | None | 410422 | 4.0 | 2015-11-22 11:11:50 | This place is really close to my house, and I popped over with my mom one day to try out some cold stuff. It's a small cozy place, with really sweet quaint decor, flowers, and soft pretty colours, and plentiful lighting, and pretty picture windows. Being really small, it ensured personal attention from the lady who helped us select our food. We had a Tutti Frutti ice cream sundae, and a cold coffee. Service was pretty fast and both tasted really good. The prices are pretty affordable, considering the great quality of the stuff we tasted. I'll definitely go back for more. It's perfect for an evening outing with a few friends, or as a me-time excursion. A plus point is the huge range of Paperboat products they have! |

The cafe is small with seating arrangements for 10 -12 approx. The decor is minimum but eye soothing. A guitar is available for playin ,if anyone wants too. The choice of music played is quite good. Airconditioning is comfortable. Only one staff is maintaining the cafe along with the owner, and they are nice. Price is affordable with variety of snacks and rolls and parathas. Tried cold coffee and chicken momo, and the momo is yummm...too good. Located very near to my house wud like to go there very soon. |
